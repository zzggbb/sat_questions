          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. "Again and again" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that new calculations revealed increasingly precise coordinates for the location of the prime meridian—refers to events that occurred multiple times in the decades after the establishment of the prime meridian in 1884 (which is described in the preceding sentence).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "specifically" illogically signals that the information in this sentence provides specific, precise details elaborating on the description of the prime meridian’s establishment in the previous sentence. Instead, the sentence indicates that increasingly precise coordinates were revealed on multiple occasions in the decades following the meridian’s establishment. Choice B is incorrect because "to that end" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a means of accomplishing a goal established in the previous sentence about the prime meridian’s establishment. Instead, the sentence indicates that increasingly precise coordinates were revealed on multiple occasions in the decades following the meridian’s establishment. Choice D is incorrect because "granted" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is in opposition to the information about the prime meridian’s establishment in the previous sentence. Instead, the sentence indicates that increasingly precise coordinates were revealed on multiple occasions in the decades following the meridian’s establishment.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between the two specimens, noting that Sue and Big Mike are members of the same genus: <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence only provides information about where one of the specimens (Sue) can be found; it doesn’t emphasize a similarity between the two specimens. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence only provides information about one specimen (Big Mike); it doesn’t emphasize a similarity between the two specimens. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence contrasts the locations of Sue and Big Mike; it doesn’t emphasize a similarity between the two specimens.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence provides an overview of the Haber-Bosch process, explaining that it uses an iron catalyst, high temperatures, and high pressures to manufacture ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence identifies some of the process’s required components (nitrogen, hydrogen, and an iron catalyst), the overview is incomplete; it doesn’t explain what the process does (produces ammonia) or mention the conditions needed for it to function (high temperatures and pressures). Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence indicates who invented the process (Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch) and that it produces ammonia, the overview is incomplete; it doesn’t mention any of the necessary ingredients or conditions. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the inventors of the process along with the required conditions (high temperatures and pressures), it doesn’t explain that the process produces ammonia or indicate what components are needed.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “That is” logically signals that this sentence clarifies the terms of the scientific debate introduced in the previous sentence by explaining the difference between dispersalists and vicariancists. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “furthermore” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is merely additional to (and separate from) the information in the previous sentence about the scientific debate. Instead, the information about dispersalists and vicariancists clarifies the terms of that debate.

Instead, the information about dispersalists and vicariancists clarifies the terms of that debate. Choice C is incorrect because “similarly” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is merely similar to the information in the previous sentence about the scientific debate.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. “Ultimately” means “in the long run” or “at the highest level.” Although Bolívar wrote to a local merchant, his ultimate goal was to send a message to political leaders in Europe. Therefore, “ultimately” fits perfectly in this context. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. However, the second part of the sentence actually disagrees with the first part. Bolívar addressed the letter to Cullen, but he was really sending a message to someone else. Notice how the contrast word “though” also acts as a transition between these ideas. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition. Bolívar’s writing of the letter to Cullen would not cause him to have a goal of persuading European powers to support him. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition. Bolívar’s writing of the letter to Cullen would not cause him to have a goal of persuading European powers to support him. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. "In addition" logically signals that the claim in this sentence—that the Inca of South America may have used quipus to record more complex information—is an additional point related to the previous statement about the Inca using quipus to record countable information.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "as a result" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence is a consequence or result of the previous statement about the Inca using quipus to record countable information. Instead, the possibility that the Inca used quipus to record more complex information is an additional point about how the quipus were used. Choice B is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence is merely a paraphrase or restatement of the previous statement about the Inca using quipus to record countable information. Instead, the possibility that the Inca used quipus to record more complex information is an additional point about how the quipus were used. Choice D is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence exemplifies the previous statement about the Inca using quipus to record countable information. Instead, the possibility that the Inca used quipus to record more complex information is an additional point about how the quipus were used.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. “Additionally” logically signals that the claim in this sentence—that some Supreme Court justices worry that viewers (of televised court arguments) would watch only short, misleading clips—adds to the information in the previous sentence. Specifically, the previous sentence indicates one concern raised by those opposed to televising the court’s oral arguments, and the claim that follows indicates a second, additional concern. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “however” illogically signals that the claim in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "Then" signals that this sentence’s claim about Darwin and Wallace follows logically from the previous information. In other words, both scientists independently arriving at the theory of natural selection was, arguably, an expected outcome of the circumstances mentioned in the previous sentence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "however" illogically signals that the claim in this sentence contrasts with the previous information about the ideas circulating among British scientists in the 1800s. Instead, this claim follows logically from that information. Choice C is incorrect because "moreover" illogically signals that the claim in this sentence merely adds to the previous information about the ideas circulating among British scientists in the 1800s. Instead, this claim follows logically from that information. Choice D is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that this sentence provides an example supporting the previous information about the ideas circulating among British scientists in the 1800s. Instead, it presents a claim that follows logically from that information.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. The first sentence makes the claim that using grime-eating bacteria has led to “impressive results.” This sentence supports that claim by describing the specific findings of the biologists’ experimentation. The transition “in many cases” fits the context perfectly. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both claim that grime-eating bacteria are better at cleaning artworks than chemicals. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in context. The fact that the results of the experimentation have been impressive overall doesn’t cause the bacteria to have proven more effective. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new idea. But this sentence doesn’t introduce a new idea. Instead, it elaborates on the same idea laid out in the previous sentence by describing the “impressive results” in more detail. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence contrasts first-class levers and second-class levers, explaining that the fulcrum in a first-class lever is between the effort and the load, whereas in a second-class lever the load is between the effort and the fulcrum.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence defines two terms associated with levers; it doesn’t contrast first-class levers and second-class levers. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence seems to acknowledge a general difference in fulcrum and load locations between first-class and second-class levers, it does not specify what this difference is. Moreover, the sentence could be read as emphasizing a similarity—that in both types of levers, the fulcrum and load are in different locations. The sentence thus fails to effectively contrast the two types of levers. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence describes a similarity between first-class and second-class levers; it doesn’t contrast them.</p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer. This choice emphasizes a difference between the two books by using relevant information from the notes to contrast their genres. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice mentions a difference between the books (their different topics), but it emphasizes a similarity between the books (their influence on readers). Choice C is incorrect.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. This sentence compares two examples of Posey’s tone: the “heartfelt language” he used in his poetry versus the “humor and satire” he used in his journalism. We know from these descriptions and from the claim in the previous sentence that the two tones are very different from each other. So the transition “by contrast” fits the context perfectly. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in other words. But the text isn’t restating the first example here. Instead, it’s offering a second, totally different example. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means “admittedly.” But the text isn’t admitting or conceding anything here. Instead, these two examples work together to support the claim made in the first sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But these two examples are intentionally very different from each other, so “similarly” doesn’t make sense here. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. “Fittingly” is a transition that means “appropriately” or “suitably,” and it is appropriate that writers who adopted their style from Okot p’Bitek would be known as the Okot School poets. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence is not disagreeing with anything—rather, it’s discussing how it makes sense for those writers who adopted Okot’s style to be known as the Okot School poets. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that compares two ideas. But this sentence is not comparing the Okot School poets and their style to Okot’s style. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence is not disagreeing with anything—rather, it’s discussing how it makes sense for those writers who adopted Okot’s style to be known as the Okot School poets. </p>

          <p>While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fifth Solvay Conference on Physics was held in 1927.</li>
<li>It brought together twenty-nine of the era’s preeminent scientists to discuss the emerging field of quantum theory.</li>
<li>The conference famously featured a debate between physicists Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr.</li>
<li>Bohr proposed that subatomic entities like electrons had only probable realities until they were observed.</li>
<li>Einstein argued that subatomic entities like electrons had a reality independent of observation.</li>
<li>Bohr’s position, later called the Copenhagen interpretation, remains the most widely accepted theory of quantum mechanics. </li>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence places Einstein’s argument within the historical context of the development of quantum theory, noting that his argument—made during the dawn of the field—conflicted with Bohr’s argument, which became the widely accepted view.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence misrepresents information from the notes, attributing the argument that electrons had a reality independent of observation to Bohr, not Einstein. In addition, while the sentence provides the date of the conference, it doesn’t place Einstein’s argument in the context of the development of quantum theory. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence indicates that Einstein attended the 1927 Solvay Conference; it doesn’t identify Einstein’s argument or place it in the historical context of the development of quantum theory. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence explains that Einstein and Bohr had a famous debate in 1927 and that Bohr’s argument remained popular decades afterward; it doesn’t identify Einstein’s argument or place it in the context of the development of quantum theory.</p>

<li>Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) is a form of additive manufacturing that utilizes light to rapidly cure liquid resin into high-quality, 3D objects.</li>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The previous sentence tells us that potters think about the look and use of a piece when selecting clay. This sentence provides a specific example of a type of clay selected for its appearance, so the transition "for example" fits perfectly.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea. But this sentence does more than just restate the previous idea. Instead, it provides a more specific example of the idea presented in the first sentence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both sentences suggest that desired look plays a role in the selection of clay types for pottery pieces. Choice C is incorrect.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. This sentence compares a chiral molecule to an achiral one. It discusses how when a chiral molecule is flipped, it results in something very different than when an achiral molecule is flipped. So the transition "by contrast" fits the context perfectly.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in different words. But this sentence doesn’t restate the same idea as the previous sentence. Instead, it makes a new point about a different type of molecule (chiral instead of achiral). Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example, which doesn’t make sense here. The second sentence isn’t an example of the first sentence’s claim about achiral molecules: it actually introduces an entirely different idea that focuses on chiral molecules. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But this sentence shows a contrast with the first sentence—namely, that a chiral molecule acts very differently from an achiral molecule when flipped.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. Noting that the evidence suggests Indigenous peoples may have found dinosaur remains in 1100 CE, the sentence emphasizes how the 1990 discovery challenged Plot’s reputation as the first person to discover dinosaur remains.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence does emphasize that Benoit challenged Plot’s reputation, it
misrepresents information in the notes; Plot was reputed to be the first person to discover dinosaur remains in general, not the first person to discover <em>M. carinatus</em> remains specifically. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence only partially explains the significance of the 1990 discovery, noting that it suggests Indigenous people brought dinosaur remains to the cave in 1100 CE; it doesn’t explain the discovery’s significance to Plot’s reputation. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence does emphasize that the discovery challenged Plot’s reputation, it misrepresents information in the notes. The notes don’t indicate that the 1990 discovery cast any doubt on Plot’s claims to have found fossilized dinosaur bones; rather, the discovery challenged Plot’s reputation for being the first to discover dinosaur bones.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between glaciers and icebergs in Greenland, noting that both melt and thereby contribute to rising sea levels.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence provides information about the melting rate of icebergs in Greenland; it doesn’t emphasize a similarity between glaciers and icebergs in Greenland. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes a difference between glaciers and icebergs in Greenland, noting that their melting rates depend on different factors; it doesn’t emphasize a similarity. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence explains the conditions under which glaciers in Greenland melt; it doesn’t emphasize a similarity between glaciers and icebergs in Greenland.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. "Likewise" is a transition that indicates the addition of a new but related idea. In this sentence, the author is providing another similar example to that discussed in the previous sentence. Therefore, "likewise" works best in this context.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means "admittedly." But the text isn’t admitting or conceding anything here. Instead, these two examples work together to support the claim made in the first sentence. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The second story is not an example of the story in the previous sentence—it’s another, similar story. And while both stories exemplify the first sentence in the text, the transition we’re looking for isn’t actually connected to that sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The first story didn’t result in the events of the second story.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “As a result” logically signals that the claim in this sentence—that spiders can cling to and climb almost any surface—is because of the previous information about the bonding properties of spiders’ spatulae. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “for instance” illogically signals that the claim in this sentence exemplifies the information in the previous sentences.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "In comparison" logically signals that the description of savannas in this sentence—that they are drier and their trees are spaced further apart—forms a comparison with the description of tropical forests in the previous sentence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "for instance" illogically signals that the description of savannas in this sentence exemplifies the description of tropical forests in the previous sentence. Instead, this description forms a comparison with the description of tropical forests. Choice C is incorrect because "firstly" illogically signals that the description of savannas in this sentence indicates the first in a series of things. Instead, this description forms a comparison with the description of tropical forests in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect because "in conclusion" illogically signals that the description of savannas in this sentence concludes or summarizes information in the previous sentences. Instead, this description forms a comparison with the description of tropical forests in the previous sentence.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. “Similarly” logically signals that the activity described in this sentence (Nancy Tuttle Craig distributing Votes for Women Tea in her Los Angeles grocery stores) is like the activity described in the previous sentence (the Woman’s Suffrage Party selling Equality Tea at fairs in San Francisco). Together, the two examples support the preceding claim that “activists across the state sold tea to promote the cause of suffrage.” </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “for example” illogically signals that the activity described in this sentence exemplifies the activity described in the previous sentence. Instead, the two activities are similar, and both support the preceding claim about selling tea to promote women’s right to vote. Choice B is incorrect because “to conclude” illogically signals that the activity described in this sentence concludes or summarizes the information in the previous sentences. Instead, the activity is similar to the one described in the previous sentence, and both support the preceding claim about selling tea to promote women’s right to vote. Choice D is incorrect because “in other words” illogically signals that the activity described in this sentence paraphrases the activity described in the previous sentence. Instead, the two activities are similar, and both support the preceding claim about selling tea to promote women’s right to vote. </p>

"Fittingly" logically signals that the naming of an unprecedented radiocarbon surge for Fusa Miyake is appropriate to the situation, since Miyake is the person who identified the surge (through her Yaku Island tree-ring analysis).</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is similar to the previous information about Miyake’s identification of a massive radiation burst through tree-ring analysis. Instead, the naming of the event for its discoverer is a fitting and appropriate outcome. Choice C is incorrect because "however" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the previous information about Miyake’s identification of a massive radiation burst through tree-ring analysis. Instead, the naming of the event for its discoverer is a fitting and appropriate outcome. Choice D is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a paraphrase or restatement of the previous information about Miyake’s identification of a massive radiation burst through tree-ring analysis.  Instead, the naming of the event for its discoverer is a fitting and appropriate outcome.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. "What’s more" logically signals that this sentence introduces an additional aspect of Wadud’s poem beyond what was previously discussed. While the previous sentence establishes that Adnan’s painting has inspired "the poem’s exploration of temporality and identity," this sentence provides a separate, additional claim about the poem: that it reflects on poetry’s relationship to other art forms.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a paraphrase or restatement of the previous point about how Adnan’s painting has inspired "the poem’s exploration of temporality and identity." Instead, the sentence provides a separate, additional claim about the poem. Choice B is incorrect because "for instance" illogically signals that the information in this sentence supports the previous point about "the poem’s exploration of temporality and identity" by providing an example. Instead, the sentence provides a separate, additional claim about the poem. Choice D is incorrect because "conversely" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is contrary to the previous point about how Adnan’s painting has inspired "the poem’s exploration of temporality and identity." Instead, the sentence provides a separate, additional claim about the poem.</p>

The sentence emphasizes the order in which two of Jordan Bennett’s exhibitions were held, indicating that <em>Wije’wi</em> took place in 2017 and <em>Ketu’elmita’jik</em> took place a year later (2018). </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence mentions that exhibitions of Jordan Bennett’s paintings took place in 2017 and 2018, it doesn’t identify the exhibitions or emphasize the order in which they were held. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions two of Jordan Bennett’s exhibitions<em>,</em> it doesn’t indicate the order in which they were held. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence mentions two of Jordan Bennett’s exhibitions and specifies when one of them was held, it doesn’t state when the exhibition at the Grenfell Art Gallery occurred. Thus, the order in which the two exhibitions were held isn’t clearly established in the sentence. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence describes an experience that the viewer has when they’re looking at the photos: they imagine other planets. This sentence describes an experience that the viewer has afterward: the title reminds them that the photos are of frying pans, bringing them back to reality. “Ultimately” is a transition that means “eventually” or “in the end,” so it fits the context perfectly. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The viewer imagining other planets when they’re looking at the photos doesn’t cause the title to bring them back to reality. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates another option or possibility, which doesn’t make sense here. Rather, the viewer has both experiences: first the viewer imagines that they’re looking at another planet, and then the title reminds them that it’s just a frying pan. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of an agreeing idea. But the viewer’s experience in the second sentence is actually the opposite of the viewer’s experience in the first sentence. In the first sentence, the viewer is imagining that they’re seeing a landscape from another planet. In the second sentence, the viewer is reminded that they’re looking at a frying pan. </p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes the order in which the two lighthouse keepers began their careers, noting that McNeil, who became the keeper at Bridgeport Breakwater Light in 1904, began her career years after Younghans, who became the keeper at Biloxi Light in 1867.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it makes a generalization about the effects of McNeil’s and Younghans’s work; it doesn’t emphasize the order in which the two keepers began their careers.

Choice B is incorrect. The sentence claims that Younghans and McNeil were crucial to ensuring the safety of watercraft before lighthouses became automated; it doesn’t emphasize the order in which the two keepers began their careers. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes when the lighthouse keepers’ respective careers ended; it doesn’t emphasize the order in which the two keepers began their careers.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. "As a result" logically signals that the information in the sentence—that, in the US House of Representatives, the entire state of Alaska has just one district—is the result or consequence of Alaska having only about 730,000 people. This is slightly below the average for House districts, which are designed to have roughly equal populations.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that Alaska having just one state district is an alternative to the information about the state’s population in the previous sentence. Rather, the fact that Alaska has just one district is a result or consequence of the entire state having slightly fewer people than an average-sized district. Choice C is incorrect because "finally" illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Alaska having just one district indicates a last step in a process or a concluding summary. Instead, the fact that Alaska has just one district is a result or consequence of the entire state having slightly fewer people than an average-sized district. Choice D is incorrect because "for instance" illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Alaska having just one district exemplifies the information about the state’s population in the previous sentence. Instead, the fact that Alaska has just one district is a result or consequence of the entire state having slightly fewer people than an average-sized district.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "Instead" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that Bartholdi decided to slim and tilt out the arm of the Statue of Liberty—contrasts with Eiffel’s design suggestions for the statue.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "additionally" illogically suggests that the information in this sentence is merely an additional fact related to Eiffel’s design suggestions in the previous sentence. Instead, it contrasts with those suggestions. Choice C is incorrect because "thus" illogically signals that the information that follows is a result of Eiffel’s design suggestions in the previous sentence. Instead, it contrasts with those suggestions. Choice D is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that the information about Bartholdi’s design decisions in this sentence exemplifies Eiffel’s design suggestions in the previous sentence. Instead, it contrasts with those suggestions.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence uses "unlike" to emphasize a difference in how katydids and crab spiders use mimicry, noting that crab spiders use mimicry to ambush prey while katydids use it to hide from predators.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence does contrast katydids and crab spiders, it misrepresents the information in the notes. Katydids mimic the appearance of leaves (not flowers), whereas crab spiders mimic the appearance of flowers (not leaves). Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence indicates that katydids and crab spiders use mimicry, it doesn’t emphasize a difference in how they use it. Choice D is incorrect.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “In addition” logically signals that the information in this sentence—that the Twentieth Amendment requires newly elected US senators and representatives to be sworn in on January 3—is separate from and additional to the amendment’s mandate concerning presidential inaugurations. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “instead” illogically signals that the information in the sentence presents an alternative to or substitute for the Twentieth Amendment’s mandate concerning presidential inaugurations. Rather, the sentence presents a separate requirement in addition to that one. Choice B is incorrect because “for instance” illogically signals that the information in the sentence exemplifies the Twentieth Amendment’s mandate concerning presidential inaugurations. Instead, the sentence presents a separate requirement in addition to that one. Choice C is incorrect because “specifically” illogically signals that the sentence provides specific, precise details elaborating on the Twentieth Amendment’s mandate concerning presidential inaugurations. Instead, the sentence presents a separate requirement in addition to that one. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. This choice introduces Wong and <em>VGHS</em> in an active and specific way, as if to an audience unfamiliar with the series. It also sets up the time and genre of the web series, which are useful ways to introduce the series of events in a narrative. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice isn’t suited for beginning a narrative. A narrative is a story that follows a sequence of events and creates interest and suspense for the reader. This choice jumps to the end, explaining the success of <em>VGHS</em> without explaining what it is. Choice C is incorrect. This choice isn’t suited for beginning a narrative. It doesn’t actually introduce the web series by name. It just jumps to later in the story without sufficient explanation. Choice D is incorrect. This choice is not very effective for beginning a narrative. It doesn’t explain what <em>VGHS</em> is, and it doesn’t mention Wong. </p>

While the sentence presents the methodology of the study—that is, the approach taken by the researchers—it fails to summarize the study as a whole. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence presents the aim, or goal, of the study, it fails to summarize the study as a whole. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence indicates what Shepard studied, it fails to mention a key factor: the effect of wind. It thus fails to summarize the study as a whole. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "Indeed" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that the sculpture raised the question of whether displaying any object in an art gallery transforms the object into a work of art—offers emphasis in support of the claim in the previous sentence that the sculpture was intended to challenge conceptions about the nature of art.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "similarly" illogically signals that information in this sentence is similar to the claim about the sculptor’s intention in the previous sentence. Instead, the information about the question raised by the sculpture offers emphasis in support of that claim. Choice C is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is an alternative to the claim about the sculptor’s intention in the previous sentence. Rather, the information about the question raised by the sculpture offers emphasis in support of that claim. Choice D is incorrect because "in addition" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is merely an additional fact related to the claim about the sculptor’s intention in the previous sentence. Instead, the information about the question raised by the sculpture offers emphasis in support of that claim.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence effectively describes <em>Unwoven Light</em> to an audience unfamiliar with Park, noting that Soo Sunny Park is a Korean American artist and that the 2013 work consists of colorful prisms formed by light passing through iridescent tiles. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes aspects of <em>Unwoven Light</em> but doesn’t mention who Park is; it thus doesn’t effectively describe the work to an audience unfamiliar with Park. Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence indicates when the work was created and who Park is, it lacks descriptive details and thus doesn’t effectively describe <em>Unwoven Light</em>. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence mentions Park and describes an aspect of <em>Unwoven Light</em>—the chain-link fence—but doesn’t effectively describe the overall work to an audience unfamiliar with the artist. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. “Thus” logically signals that the action described in this sentence—the researcher being able to determine the chemical makeup of the planet’s bright regions based on how they reflect light—is a result or consequence of the previous information about spectroscopic fingerprints. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “regardless” illogically signals that the action described in this sentence occurs despite the previous information about spectroscopic fingerprints. Instead, the finding in this sentence is a result or consequence of that information. Choice B is incorrect because “meanwhile” illogically signals that the action described in this sentence either occurs at the same time as or offers an alternative to the previous information about spectroscopic fingerprints. Instead, the finding in this sentence is a result or consequence of that information. Choice D is incorrect because “in comparison” illogically signals that the action described in this sentence is being compared with the previous information about spectroscopic fingerprints. Instead, the finding in this sentence is a result or consequence of that information. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence presents both the study and its findings, noting the study’s date and the researcher’s name as well as describing what the researcher determined about the jawbones and how she determined it. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence describes the study and the researcher’s initial assessment, it doesn’t present the study’s findings. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence describes the study and its focus, it doesn’t present the study’s findings or the name of the researcher who conducted it. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the study’s methodology and provides information about pterosaurs, it doesn’t present the study’s findings. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “Thus” logically signals that the claim in this sentence—that animals performing only basic actions should allocate relatively few resources to their brain tissue—is a consequence of the previous sentence’s claim about the energy demands of animal brains (namely, that the more diverse an animal’s behaviors, the more energy its brain needs). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “subsequently” illogically signals that the claim in this sentence occurs later in a chronological sequence of events than the previous sentence’s claim about the energy demands of animal brains. Instead, the second claim is a consequence of the first.

Instead, the second claim is a consequence of the first. Choice C is incorrect because “nevertheless” illogically signals that the claim in this sentence is true in spite of the previous sentence’s claim about the energy demands of animal brains. Instead, the second claim is a consequence of the first. </p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer. Noting that the Sun (9,800°F) is hotter than most stars within 10 parsecs of it, the sentence emphasizes how hot the Sun is relative to nearby stars. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence explains that astronomer Todd Henry determined the classifications for the Sun and several other stars nearby; it doesn’t emphasize how hot the Sun is relative to nearby stars. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence explains that the majority of stars near the Sun are classified as K or M stars; it doesn’t indicate the Sun’s temperature or emphasize how hot it is relative to nearby stars. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence indicates that the Sun is classified differently than most nearby stars due to its surface temperature, it doesn’t emphasize how hot the Sun is relative to nearby stars. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence defines the term "georeferencing," stating that it is the process of assigning geographic coordinates to an image so that mapping software can place the image in its real-world location.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes López Marrero’s team’s 2017 project; it doesn’t provide a definition of the term "georeferencing." Moreover, it misrepresents the information in the notes by characterizing the team’s assignment of geographic coordinates to photographs as a process distinct from georeferencing. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence states that López Marrero’s team used georeferencing, but it doesn’t provide a definition of the term. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence explains why a particular group of georeferenced aerial photographs is potentially useful for researchers; it doesn’t provide a definition of the term "georeferencing."</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “Specifically” logically signals that the information in this sentence about Sauer’s argument—that, according to Sauer, cultures play a role in their own development, as opposed to being shaped solely by natural surroundings—provides specific, precise details elaborating on the more general information in the previous sentence about how Sauer challenged prevailing views about how natural landscapes influence human cultures. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “similarly” illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Sauer’s argument is similar to, but separate from, the more general information in the previous sentence. Instead, it provides specific, precise details elaborating on that information. Choice B is incorrect because “finally” illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Sauer’s argument indicates a last step in a process or a concluding summary. Instead, it provides specific, precise details elaborating on the general information in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect because “therefore” illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Sauer’s argument is a result of the more general information in the previous sentence. Instead, it provides specific, precise details elaborating on that information. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence presents the significance of the Hart-Celler Act to an audience unfamiliar with the history of US immigration, noting that the 1965 act abolished the national-origins quota system and explaining why that mattered, historically: because the old quota system had favored immigrants from northern Europe. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes an aspect of immigration policy at the time the Hart-Celler Act was proposed; it doesn’t present the significance of the Hart-Celler Act to an audience unfamiliar with the history of US immigration. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence describes an aspect of immigration policy before the Hart-Celler Act; it doesn’t describe or present the significance of the act to an audience unfamiliar with the history of US immigration. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence indicates that the Hart-Celler Act abolished the old quota system, it doesn’t explain the act or the quota system to an audience unfamiliar with the history of US immigration. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a difference between the portraits, noting that one is a painting and the other is a drawing. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes a similarity between the two portraits rather than a difference. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence makes a generalization about Enriquez’s portraits; it doesn’t emphasize a difference between the portraits of Jimenez and Anaya. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence notes a difference between Jimenez and Anaya, it doesn’t emphasize a difference between, or even mention, their portraits. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. "For instance" logically signals that the concise, witty exchange between Philip II and the Spartans is an example supporting the previous claim—that the Spartans employed wit even in the face of peril.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "rather" illogically signals that the exchange between Philip II and the Spartans contrasts with the previous claim about the Spartans’ wit. Instead, the exchange is an example of their wit. Choice B is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the exchange between Philip II and the Spartans is a restatement of the previous claim about the Spartans’ wit. Instead, the exchange is an example of their wit. Choice C is incorrect because "that said" illogically signals that the exchange between Philip II and the Spartans is an exception to the previous claim about the Spartans’ wit. Instead, the exchange is an example of their wit.</p>

This choice uses a quotation to convey the authors’ criticism and challenge to the wood-wide web theory due to an absence of evidence. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t emphasize a potential problem with the wood-wide web theory. It uses a quotation to introduce the theory and its originator.

It uses a quotation to describe the appeal and interest of the theory, but it doesn’t indicate why the authors are concerned or what evidence they have. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t use a quotation at all. It paraphrases the main idea of the 2022 study, but it doesn’t include any specific words or phrases from the notes.

        <p>Choice A is the best answer. This sentence emphasizes just how far maglev advocates’ dreams are from coming true. “In fact” is a transition used to emphasize the truth of a statement that modifies the previous statement and therefore fits perfectly in this context. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Maglev advocates’ dream remaining unrealized would not cause there to be only a few maglev trains, all located in Asia.

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a difference between surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetras, noting that while surface-dwelling tetras can see, cave-dwelling tetras can’t. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence notes that surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetras are different, it doesn’t emphasize any difference between the two populations of tetras. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence explains that cave-dwelling tetras use sensory receptors on their skulls to navigate; it doesn’t emphasize a difference between surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling tetras. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence notes that there are two different populations of Mexican tetras, it doesn’t emphasize any difference between the two populations. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. "There" indicates that the work of calculating Coordinated Universal Time takes place at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in France. Because "there" indicates a location, it fits the context perfectly.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. This sentence is describing where the work of coordinating Coordinated Universal Time takes place, not giving an example of the work described in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. This sentence is describing where the work of coordinating Coordinated Universal Time takes place, not giving an example of the work described in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous sentence. They both describe the work involved in calculating Coordinated Universal Time.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. "Additionally" logically signals that guard cells’ role in regulating water loss is an additional function of these specialized plant cells that is separate from the function of regulating carbon dioxide intake.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "previously" illogically signals that the activity described in this sentence occurs earlier in a chronological sequence of events than the regulation of carbon dioxide intake described in the previous sentence. Instead, regulating water loss is an additional function of guard cells that is separate from the function of regulating carbon dioxide intake. Choice C is incorrect because "in conclusion" illogically signals that the description of guard cells’ role in regulating water loss concludes or summarizes the information about guard cells provided in the previous sentences. Instead, regulating water loss is one of the two distinct functions of guard cells described in the text. Choice D is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that the activity described in this sentence happens in place of the activity of regulating carbon dioxide intake described in the previous sentence. Rather, regulating water loss is an additional function of guard cells.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence uses “whereas” to contrast the emissivities of the two fibers, noting that the emissivity of the reflective metal fibers was just 0.02, far lower than that of the silicon carbide fibers (0.74). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes the ability of reflective metal fibers and silicon carbide fibers to emit heat; it doesn’t contrast the emissivities of the two fibers. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence states a law of thermodynamics: the amount of heat a material absorbs is equal to the amount it emits. The sentence doesn’t contrast the emissivity of reflective metal fibers with that of silicon carbide fibers. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence includes a generalization about the emissivities of reflective metal fibers and silicon carbide fibers, it emphasizes Abebe’s plans for their use in a garment; it doesn’t contrast the emissivities of the two fibers. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. Noting the time frame of the US Civil War and the fact that Amos enlisted during this time frame, the sentence emphasizes that Amos’s enlistment date places him among the historically significant group of US Navy sailors of Filipino descent who served during the Civil War.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence identifies Amos and Ignases and notes that Amos’s enlistment date was later than Ignases’s; the sentence doesn’t explain the historical significance of the date. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence identifies Amos and Ignases as US Navy sailors of Filipino descent, noting Ignases’s birth year; the sentence doesn’t provide Amos’s enlistment date or its historical significance. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence provides Amos’s enlistment date and mentions that he served alongside a sailor of Filipino descent; it doesn’t explain the historical significance of the date.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "For this reason" logically signals that the reason Joseph Priestley termed oxygen "dephlogisticated air" was that he accepted the theory mentioned in the previous sentence—that the presence of phlogiston, rather than the absence of oxygen, causes fire in a closed container to go out.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the information about Priestley terming oxygen "dephlogisticated air" is a restatement of the previous theory concerning phlogiston. Instead, Priestley chose the term as a result of this theory. Choice C is incorrect because "alternatively" illogically signals that Priestley termed oxygen "dephlogisticated air" as an alternative to the previous theory concerning phlogiston. Instead, Priestley chose the term as a result of this theory. Choice D is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that Priestley termed oxygen "dephlogisticated air" despite the previous theory concerning phlogiston. Instead, Priestley chose the term as a result of this theory.</p>

"Indeed" logically signals that the description of the art installation in this sentence—its blue room and preening unicorn that leave visitors "dazzled and confused"—offers additional emphasis in support of the previous sentence’s claim about the installation’s "whimsical yet perplexing experience."</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "second" illogically signals that the description in this sentence is a second, separate claim from the previous sentence’s claim about the installation’s "whimsical yet perplexing experience." Instead, the specific details describing the installation emphasize and support the previous claim. Choice B is incorrect because "instead" illogically signals that the description in this sentence is an alternative to the previous sentence’s claim about the installation’s "whimsical yet perplexing experience." Rather, the specific details describing the installation emphasize and support that claim. Choice D is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that the description in this sentence is true despite the previous sentence’s claim about the installation’s "whimsical yet perplexing experience." Instead, the specific details describing the installation emphasize and support that claim.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. This sentence is arguing that new evidence contradicting popular beliefs about “tulip mania” should cast doubt on those beliefs. “Therefore” is a cause-and-effect transition, which fits perfectly in this context. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Skepticism about the popular beliefs is not an example of recent evidence contradicting those beliefs—rather, skepticism is an effect of that recent evidence. Choice B is incorrect.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence contrasts the two samples, noting that the SEBS rubber sample, at 4 millimeters thick, was thicker than the TPU sample, which was 3 millimeters thick.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the sentence mentions a similarity between the TPU fiber and the SEBS rubber; it doesn’t  contrast the two samples. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence indicates that both the SEBS rubber and TPU samples were part of the 2019 study; it doesn’t contrast the two samples. Choice C is incorrect because the sentence describes the process of torsional heating; it doesn’t contrast the two samples.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence makes a generalization about nissologists’ definition of an island—specifically, that the use of one definition rather than another can result in huge disparities in the number of islands counted—and supports that generalization by citing Sweden as an example. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence introduces one definition of an island to an audience unfamiliar with nissologists; it doesn’t make a generalization about nissologists’ definition of an island. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence synthesizes information from the notes about counts of Sweden’s islands, it doesn’t make and support a generalization about nissologists’ definition of an island. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence makes an inference about islands in Sweden; it doesn’t mention nissologists’ definition of an island or make a generalization about it. </p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The second part of the sentence says that many volcanoes use shallow pockets of magma. This is an elaboration of the same underlying idea from the first part of the sentence, which says that the super deep magma of Icelandic volcanoes’ makes them outliers. “Indeed” is a transition used for elaborating on the same idea, so it fits the context perfectly. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But these two parts of the sentence agree with each other, so “nevertheless” doesn’t make sense. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new idea. But the second part of the sentence isn’t adding a new idea: it’s elaborating on the same idea expressed in the first part of the sentence. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The fact that Iceland’s deep-magma volcanoes are outliers doesn’t cause many other volcanoes to get fed by shallow pockets of magma. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence effectively begins a narrative about the creation of the robots, explaining that ants’ gap-crossing technique inspired Yasemin Ozkan-Aydin to "set out to design" robots that could collaborate in a similar manner.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes how the robots work together to cross gaps; it doesn’t effectively begin a narrative about the creation of the robots. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence provides an overview of the steps Ozkan-Aydin took in creating the robots; it doesn’t effectively begin a narrative about their creation. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence explains how ants form bridges; it doesn’t effectively begin a narrative about the creation of the robots.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a difference between C-type and S-type asteroids, noting that C-type asteroids are mainly composed of carbon, while S-type asteroids are mainly composed of silicate minerals. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence states that C-type and S-type are two types of asteroids, but it doesn’t emphasize a difference between them. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn’t directly mention C-type or S-type asteroids. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions that 17 percent of known asteroids are S-type asteroids, it doesn’t identify the percentage of asteroids that are C-type. Therefore, the sentence doesn’t emphasize a difference between the two types. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. “Meanwhile” logically signals that the action described in this sentence (Obinze’s move to London to pursue a career) is simultaneous with the action described in the previous sentence (Ifemelu’s move to the United States). The first sentence establishes that the actions take place around the same time, referring to the characters’ “divergent experiences” following high school.  </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because “nevertheless” illogically signals that the information in this sentence about Obinze’s move to London is true despite the previous information about Ifemelu’s move to the United States. Instead, as the first sentence establishes, Obinze’s move and Ifemelu’s move are related, parallel experiences that occur around the same time. Choice C is incorrect because “secondly” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a second point or reason separate from the previous information about Ifemelu’s move to the United States. Instead, as the first sentence establishes, Obinze’s move and Ifemelu’s move are related, parallel experiences that occur around the same time. Choice D is incorrect because “in fact” illogically signals that the information in this sentence emphasizes, modifies, or contradicts the previous information about Ifemelu’s move to the United States. Instead, as the first sentence establishes, Obinze’s move and Ifemelu’s move are related, parallel experiences that occur around the same time. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence directly specifies how many chromosomes the pineapple has, as indicated in the notes: fifty.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence mentions the pineapple’s chromosomes, it doesn’t specify how many it has. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence indicates that the pineapple has more chromosomes than the melon; it doesn’t specify the exact number of chromosomes the pineapple has. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence specifies how many chromosomes the melon has, not how many the pineapple has.</p>

The sentence presents both findings from the study, noting that FTWs using marigolds both removed phosphorus from the water and yielded market-quality blooms.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence presents a finding from the study, the presentation is incomplete; the study found that marigolds cultivated on FTWs both removed phosphorus from the water and yielded market-quality blooms. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence misrepresents information in the notes. The figure of 52% refers to the amount of phosphorus removed by FTWs using marigolds when compared to the control; the marigolds’ bloom yield was 65 market-quality blooms per square meter, and it was not compared to the control.

        <p>Choice B is the best answer. “As a result” indicates that water molecules maintaining their linked structure at high pressures is caused by the strengthening of these water molecules by trimethylamine N-oxide. So the transition “as a result” fits the context perfectly. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous one—rather, it’s describing an effect of the phenomenon described in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence doesn’t disagree with the previous one; it actually expands on the previous sentence by describing an effect of the strengthened molecules. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The second sentence doesn’t provide an example or instance of the idea in the previous sentence. Instead, it explores the effects of the previous idea in more depth. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence effectively presents Tan’s research to an audience unfamiliar with Angkor Wat, explaining the results of the research and identifying Angkor Wat as a temple in Cambodia. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence presents Tan’s research, it fails to explain what Angkor Wat is for an audience unfamiliar with the temple. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes the role that decorrelation stretch analysis played in Tan’s research; it doesn’t present the research, which would require specifying where it was conducted. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence explains what Angkor Wat is, it fails to present Tan’s research. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. “Nonetheless” is a transition that indicates disagreement. The first sentence describes the unlikelihood of finding much for critical analysis in Ashbery’s poem (“barren terrain”), while the second sentence describes how Berlant did in fact find much to analyze in Ashbery’s poem (“fertile ground”), so the transition “nonetheless” fits perfectly. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new but similar idea, which doesn’t make sense here. The idea in this sentence directly contradicts the idea in the previous sentence. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in this context—a poem seemingly having little opportunity for critical analysis would not cause someone to write an extensive critical analysis (in fact, we might expect the opposite). Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea in other words. But the text isn’t restating the first idea here. Instead, it’s offering a contradiction to the idea expressed in the first sentence. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “Increasingly” logically signals that the claim in this sentence—that mathematicians are collaborating with their peers—marks a change relative to what was traditionally done. As the previous sentence explains, while mathematicians may have traditionally worked alone, evidence points to a shift in the opposite direction. The claim describes the shift: a rise in collaboration. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “similarly” illogically signals that the claim in this sentence is similar to, but separate from, the previous claim about the shift away from mathematicians working alone.

Instead, the claim about the rise in collaboration elaborates on the previous claim, describing the shift. Choice C is incorrect because “furthermore” illogically signals that the claim in this sentence is in addition to the previous claim about the shift away from mathematicians working alone.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "In so doing" logically signals that the information in this sentence about Gibson’s piece—that it blurs the distinction between contemporary art and traditional crafts—is a result or consequence of the piece’s blending of particular Native and non-Native cultural symbols.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. "Conversely" illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the previous information about the blending of particular cultural symbols in Gibson’s piece. Instead, it presents a result or consequence of that information. Choice C is incorrect. "For instance" illogically signals that this sentence provides an example supporting the previous information about the blending of particular cultural symbols in Gibson’s piece. Instead, it presents a result or consequence of that information. Choice D is incorrect. "In particular" illogically signals that this sentence provides specific details elaborating on the previous information about the blending of particular cultural symbols in Gibson’s piece. Instead, it presents a result or consequence of that information.</p>

The sentence compares some disadvantages of docked and dockless bike-share programs, explaining that while docked programs are more resource-intensive (requiring significant space and money), dockless programs have greater organizational challenges.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence compares dockless programs to docked programs, noting an advantage of docked programs: they offer order and consistency. It doesn’t compare disadvantages of the two types of programs.

However, it misrepresents information from the notes, stating that dockless programs are less flexible than docked programs. In addition, it doesn’t compare disadvantages of the two types of programs. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence emphasizes an advantage of dockless programs, then makes a general statement that applies to both types of programs; it doesn’t compare disadvantages of the two types of programs.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. “Then” indicates that the events in this sentence took place after the events in the previous sentence. Only after users upload images of unknown soldiers can those images be analyzed. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This transition is used to emphasize the truth of a statement that modifies the previous statement. But this sentence doesn’t modify the step described in the previous statement: instead, it introduces an entirely new step in the process. So “in fact” wouldn’t make sense here. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a new but related idea, which doesn’t make sense here. Analyzing the physical features in the uploaded photographs isn’t a similar idea, but rather the next step in the process. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses an exemplification transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Analyzing physical features is not an example of uploading and tagging an image. </p>

Since the first sentence talks about Thaden’s race win in 1929 and the second shifts back to talking about her record in 1928, this makes the most sense here.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with and expands on the previous sentence by describing the earlier record that Thaden had "already" held. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift forward in time, which doesn’t make sense here. A record in 1928 didn’t come after Thaden’s race win in 1929. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense in this context—an event in 1929 can’t cause something in 1928.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "For this reason" is a cause-and-effect transition. The cause in this case is that the mother elephant wants to know that her calf is safe, so the effect is that she lets out an infrasonic call for the calf to hear. Therefore, "for this reason" fits perfectly in this context.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces an example of a previous idea. But the second sentence doesn’t provide an example of the events described in the first sentence. Instead, it describes what happens next: the mother elephant calls for her calf. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a shift from the past to the current time, which doesn’t make sense here. Both sentences use the present tense, as they’re describing the same time period. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates commonality or agreement between two ideas. But this sentence isn’t similar to the events in the first sentence. Instead, it describes the events that happen next.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence effectively emphasizes a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials, stating that the MexiCali Biennial is unlike traditional biennials because it hosts exhibitions in different venues on an uneven schedule. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence indicates who founded the MexiCali Biennial and the years this biennial has taken place; it doesn’t emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence clarifies the traditional meaning of biennial with language that could apply to the MexiCali Biennial, it doesn’t mention the MexiCali Biennial by name. Therefore, the sentence doesn’t effectively emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence notes locations where various biennial exhibitions have been held; it doesn’t emphasize a difference between the MexiCali Biennial and traditional biennials. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The first sentence claims that the number of sunspots can vary greatly. To support this claim, the next two sentences compare two examples: one time when there were 180 sunspots and one time when there were only 2 sunspots. So the transition “by comparison” fits perfectly. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates a restatement of the same idea, which doesn’t make sense here. This sentence doesn’t restate the first example—it describes a totally different example. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that indicates the addition of a similar idea, which doesn’t make sense here. This sentence describes a second example that is very different from the first example. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. The first example didn’t result in the second example. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. "Thus" logically signals that the information in this clause—that listeners can "hear" carbon levels increasing—is a result of the previous information about the audio distorting as carbon levels increase.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "furthermore" illogically signals that the information in this clause merely adds to the previous information about the audio distorting as carbon levels rise. Instead, the listeners’ ability to "hear" carbon levels increasing is a result of that distortion.

Instead, the listeners’ ability to "hear" carbon levels increasing is a result of that distortion. Choice C is incorrect because "for instance" illogically signals that the information in this clause is an example of how the audio distorts as carbon levels rise. Instead, the audio was distorted for the express purpose of representing ecological data; the listeners’ ability to "hear" carbon levels increasing is a direct, intended result of the distortion, not merely an example of it.</p>

          <p>While researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little is known about the life of Wong Fei-hung (1847–1925).</li>
<li>He was born near Foshan, China, and gained local recognition as a physician and Hung Ga (also known as Hung Gar) Kung Fu master.</li>
<li>He achieved many incredible martial arts feats—some confirmed and some rumored.</li>
<li>He has become an internationally known folk hero thanks to his depiction in over a hundred films, television shows, and other media.</li>
<li>In the 1991 film <em>Once Upon a Time in China</em>, actor Jet Li portrays Wong Fei-hung using superhuman kung fu abilities to save his community.</li>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes the effect media had on building Wong Fei-hung’s legacy, noting that media depictions after his lifetime turned Wong Fei-hung into an internationally known folk hero.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While it appears to emphasize the effect of media depictions of Wong Fei-hung, the sentence misrepresents information from the notes. According to the notes, media depictions resulted in Wong Fei-hung becoming an internationally known folk hero, not a locally known physician and kung fu master. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence discusses Wong Fei-hung’s legacy, noting that he became an internationally known folk hero, but it doesn’t emphasize the effect media had on building that legacy. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence indicates that Wong Fei-hung has been depicted in many media but doesn’t emphasize the effect of these media depictions on building his legacy.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. "Though" logically signals that the claim in the sentence—that Morton’s improvisational skills helped shape jazz as a genre during its early years ("No one can deny" it)—is true despite the previous information about Morton’s exaggerated claim to have invented jazz.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "therefore" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence is a result of the previous information about Morton’s claim to have invented jazz.

Instead, the sentence states that Morton helped to shape jazz—even if his claim was an exaggeration. Choice C is incorrect because "in other words" illogically signals that the claim in the sentence is merely a paraphrase or restatement of the previous information about Morton’s claim to have invented jazz.

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “Second” logically signals that the information in this sentence—that the effort to bury the ship would likely only have been made for a king—joins the information in the previous sentence (“first…”) in supporting Brunning’s claim that the burial site was likely the tomb of a king. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “instead” illogically signals that the information in this sentence presents an alternative or substitute to the previous information about the gold artifacts inside the ship.

        <p>Choice B is the best answer. “For example” logically signals that the information in this sentence—that tadpole shrimp embryos can pause development during extended periods of drought—exemplifies the previous sentence’s claim that organisms have evolved surprising adaptations to survive in adverse conditions.  </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “in contrast” illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the claim about organisms in the previous sentence. Instead, it exemplifies this claim. Choice C is incorrect because “meanwhile” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is separate from (while occurring simultaneously with) the claim about organisms in the previous sentence. Instead, it exemplifies this claim. Choice D is incorrect because “consequently” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a consequence, or result, of the claim about organisms in the previous sentence.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “By contrast” logically signals that the finding described in this sentence contrasts with the finding described in the previous sentence. That is, quicker blinks were associated with longer talking times, whereas slower blinks were associated with shorter talking times. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “for example” illogically signals that the finding described in this sentence is an example of the finding described in the previous sentence. Instead, it contrasts with that finding.

Instead, it presents information that contrasts with that finding. Choice C is incorrect because “firstly” illogically signals that the finding described in this sentence is a first point or occurs first in a chronological sequence of events. Instead, it contrasts with the finding described in the previous sentence. </p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence uses the poem "Towards Autumn" to illustrate the form of a sestina, explaining that a sestina’s thirty-nine lines all end in one of six alternating words and showcasing that poem’s specific end words.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence identifies both of Hacker’s poems as sestinas; it doesn’t use one of the poems to illustrate the form of a sestina. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence appears to use the poem "Forage Sestina" to illustrate a feature of the sestina form, it misrepresents the information in the notes. According to the notes, "Forage Sestina" doesn’t use these six end words; it uses six other words instead. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence uses the poem "Towards Autumn" as an example of one of Hacker’s sestinas, it misrepresents the information in the notes. According to the notes, "Towards Autumn" doesn’t use these six end words; it uses six other words instead.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. “Still” logically signals that the information about Sher-Gil in this sentence—that she longed to leave Paris and return to India—contrasts with what one would expect after reading about Sher-Gil’s experiences in Paris in the previous sentences. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because “therefore” illogically signals that the information about Sher-Gil in this sentence is a result or consequence of the descriptions in the previous sentences. Instead, this information contrasts with what one would expect after reading about Sher-Gil’s experiences in Paris. Choice C is incorrect because “indeed” illogically signals that the information about Sher-Gil in this sentence offers additional emphasis in support of the descriptions in the previous sentences. Instead, this information contrasts with what one would expect after reading about Sher-Gil’s experiences in Paris. Choice D is incorrect because “furthermore” illogically signals that the information about Sher-Gil in this sentence offers additional support for or confirmation of the descriptions in the previous sentences. Instead, this information contrasts with what one would expect after reading about Sher-Gil’s experiences in Paris. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. "In turn" logically signals that the information in the sentence—that the electrical currents create a protective barrier around Earth—is a result or consequence of the previous information about the circulation of liquid metals generating electrical currents that flow between Earth’s magnetic poles.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "likewise" illogically signals that the information in the sentence is similar to the previous information about the circulation of liquid metals generating electrical currents that flow between Earth’s magnetic poles. Instead, the new information about the electrical currents is a direct result or consequence of the previous information. Choice C is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that the information in the sentence is true despite the previous information about the circulation of liquid metals generating electrical currents that flow between Earth’s magnetic poles. Instead, the new information about the electrical currents is a direct result or consequence of the previous information. Choice D is incorrect because "in reality" illogically signals that the information in the sentence contradicts the previous information about the circulation of liquid metals generating electrical currents that flow between Earth’s magnetic poles.

Choice C is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that Copeland’s statement about her greatest accomplishment exemplifies the claim about her accomplishments in the previous sentence. Instead, it offers a contrast or exception to that information. Choice D is incorrect because "second of all" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a second, separate claim from the previous sentence’s information about her accomplishments.

        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence uses the quotation from Henderson to support a claim about Tharpe’s contribution to rock ’n’ roll, noting that the impact Tharpe had on the genre led Henderson to call her "the unquestioned founding mother of rock ’n’ roll."</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence makes the claim that Tharpe had a major impact on rock ’n’ roll, it doesn’t use a quotation to support this claim. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence presents Henderson’s opinion that Tharpe had a major impact on rock ’n’ roll, but it doesn’t use a quotation to support this claim. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence includes a quotation about audience reactions to Tharpe’s music, the sentence describes Tharpe as a gospel musician; it doesn’t support a claim about her contribution to rock ’n’ roll.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The sentence effectively presents the LIGO study’s aim, noting that it is designed to detect and analyze gravitational waves, and its methodology (it uses two interferometers to detect the waves). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence describes a finding from the LIGO study; it doesn’t effectively present the study’s aim or its methodology. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence provides background information about the LIGO study’s timeline; it doesn’t effectively present the study’s aim or its methodology. Choice C is incorrect. The sentence touches on LIGO’s methodology, noting that it uses two interferometers, but doesn’t indicate what the study’s aims are. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. "Today" logically signals that the information in the sentence—that the museum is able to display close to 30% of its collection—is true of the Art Institute of Chicago as it exists in the present day after the previously mentioned unveiling of the massive new gallery in 2009.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "additionally" illogically signals that the information in the sentence is merely an additional fact related to the information about the museum before the new gallery opened. Instead, the sentence is about the museum in the present day after the new gallery opened. Choice B is incorrect because "for example" illogically signals that the information in the sentence exemplifies the previous information about the museum before the new gallery opened. Instead, the sentence is about the museum in the present day after the new gallery opened. Choice C is incorrect because "nevertheless" illogically signals that the information in the sentence is true despite the previous information about the museum before the new gallery opened. Instead, the sentence is about the museum in the present day after the new gallery opened.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer. “Later” logically signals that the event discussed in this sentence—the creation of the short film featuring Fuller’s dance—is a related event that occurred after the event discussed in the previous sentence (the 1891 debut of the dance). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “however” illogically signals that the information in this sentence contrasts with the information in the previous sentence.

Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence. Choice D is incorrect because “in other words” illogically signals that the information in this sentence is a paraphrase or restatement of the information in the previous sentence. Instead, the creation of the short film is a related event that followed the event discussed in the previous sentence. </p>

"In particular" logically signals that the information in this sentence—that maize and wheat supply chains transformed North American foodways into a global food system—provides specific, precise details elaborating on the more general information in the previous sentence about the transformation of North American foodways (with maize and wheat the "certain grains" at the center of it).</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "alternatively" illogically signals that the information in this sentence is an alternative option to the previous information about the transformation of North American foodways.

Instead, the roles of maize and wheat in creating a global food system are specific, precise details elaborating on that information.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. Scientists believe in fusion’s potential as an energy source, but have struggled to actually make it work—in other words, there is a contradiction between scientists’ beliefs and their reality. “That said” is a disagreement transition that works perfectly in this context. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a cause-and-effect transition, which doesn’t make sense here. Scientists not being able to generate extra energy from lab fusion reactions isn’t an effect of them believing in fusion’s potential. Choice B is incorrect. This transition indicates the addition of another supporting point. But this sentence is not adding a supporting point to the previous sentence—scientists not being able to successfully generate energy from fusion isn’t another point in favor of fusion meeting humanity’s clean energy needs. Choice C is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that introduces or elaborates on a particular example. But this sentence doesn’t give an example of scientists’ belief in fusion’s potential to meet humanity’s clean energy needs—in fact, it contrasts that optimistic belief with the reality of past failures to successfully employ fusion for energy production. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The sentence compares the extinction risks of the two species, noting that <em>C. olivacea</em> has a higher risk of becoming extinct in the near future than <em>C. furcatus</em>.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence does compare the extinction risks of the two species, it misrepresents information from the notes; <em>C. olivacea</em> faces a higher risk of becoming extinct in the near future than <em>C. furcatus</em>, not the other way around. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence mentions that conservation organizations have evaluated both species for extinction risk, it doesn’t compare the extinction risks of the two species. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence states that <em>C. olivacea</em> faces a high risk of extinction, it doesn’t mention <em>C. furcatus</em> or compare the extinction risks of the two species.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that “wishcycling” is harmful, the previous sentence gives us an example, and this sentence gives us another example. So “moreover”—a transition that indicates the addition of another supporting point—fits perfectly here. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice uses a transition that means “appropriately” or “suitably,” which doesn’t make sense in context. This sentence adds another example of how “wishcycling” is harmful, so we’re looking for an addition transition. Choice B is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both provide examples of how “wishcycling” is harmful. Choice D is incorrect. This choice uses a disagreement transition. But this sentence actually agrees with the previous sentence. Both provide examples of how “wishcycling” is harmful. </p>

Instead, the information about dogs contrasts with what came before.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. Using a quotation from Stewart, the sentence challenges Thucydides’s explanation that the rise of Athens caused the conflict, suggesting that it was instead caused by a "clash of cultures."</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence uses a quotation, the quotation doesn’t challenge Thucydides’s explanation of the conflict. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence mentions that Stewart challenged Thucydides’s explanation of the conflict, it doesn’t use a quotation to challenge Thucydides’s explanation: the quoted word "inevitable" is from Thucydides. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence appears to refute Thucydides’s explanation, it does so in a way that misrepresents the information in the notes; Allison’s Thucydides trap theory is based on Thucydides’s explanation of the conflict. Thus, Allison’s theory affirms, rather than challenges, Thucydides’s explanation.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The sentence explains an advantage of the Hanke-Henry calendar, noting that it supports more predictable scheduling than does the Gregorian calendar and describing how it does so (by having calendar dates occur on the same day each year). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The sentence compares the number of days in the Gregorian and Hanke-Henry calendars; it doesn’t explain an advantage of the Hanke-Henry calendar. Choice B is incorrect. While the sentence refers to a possible reason to adopt the Hanke-Henry calendar—that doing so would help solve a problem with the Gregorian calendar—it doesn’t identify the problem or the solution and thus doesn’t explain the advantage of the Hanke-Henry calendar. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence describes the origins of the Hanke-Henry calendar; it doesn’t explain an advantage of it. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. The sentence emphasizes a difference between the eggs of the two species, directly contrasting the shorter average length of <em>Gygis alba</em> eggs (4.46 cm) with the longer average length of <em>Gavia stellata</em> eggs (7.22 cm).</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the sentence mentions both bird species, it doesn’t emphasize a difference between their eggs. Choice C is incorrect. While the sentence provides information about the two bird species, it doesn’t emphasize a difference between their eggs. Choice D is incorrect. While the sentence provides the average lengths of both species’ eggs, it doesn’t explicitly emphasize the difference between them.</p>

The sentence recounts the sequence of events proposed by the researchers: a large moon orbiting Saturn came close enough to the planet that it was broken apart by tidal forces, and the resulting debris formed Saturn’s rings.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the sentence misrepresents information from the notes; according to the notes, tidal forces, not debris, caused the moon to break apart. Choice B is incorrect. The sentence offers information relevant to the 2022 study but doesn’t recount the sequence of events proposed by the researchers. Choice D is incorrect. The sentence recounts a sequence, but it’s a sequence of the researchers’ activities, not the sequence of events proposed by the researchers.</p>

This choice most effectively emphasizes "a similarity" by identifying a trait the works share: "both Erasure and Home Grown include discarded objects."</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This choice doesn’t "emphasize a similarity." Instead, this choice shows how the materials used in the two works are different. Notice the use of the contrast word "however." Choice B is incorrect. This choice doesn’t "emphasize a similarity between the two works." While it says that Tubbs’s work "often features discarded objects," it doesn’t provide details about the two works in question. Choice D is incorrect. This choice doesn’t "emphasize a similarity." Instead, this choice shows how the works were produced at different times.</p>
