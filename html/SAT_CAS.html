          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Marilyn Dingle’s baskets. In this context, to say that Dingle’s baskets are “handmade from” particular plants means that Dingle creates baskets herself using those plants but without using machines. The text says that Dingle “skillfully winds” parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that “no factory can reproduce.” This context suggests that Dingle’s baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Dingle uses sweetgrass and palmetto palm to create her baskets, not how her baskets are “indicated by,” or signified by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice C is incorrect. Although Dingle’s baskets are described as being made using sweetgrass and palm, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the baskets are “represented by,” or exemplified or portrayed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the focus of the text is on Dingle’s use of sweetgrass and palmetto palm and the impossibility of replicating the appearance of her baskets using machines. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Dingle’s baskets are “collected with,” or brought together in a group with, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Instead, the text describes how Dingle uses those plants to make her baskets. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the invention of the integrated circuit. As used in this context, "transformed" means substantially changed in some way. The text states that the invention radically altered the semiconductor industry, with some historians claiming that it had a fundamental effect on the industry by allowing for mass production for the first time. This context conveys that the invention of the integrated circuit transformed the semiconductor industry.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the invention of the integrated circuit significantly affected ("radically altered") the semiconductor industry, it doesn’t indicate that the invention "overwhelmed" the industry, which in this context would mean that it overcame the industry such that the industry struggled or was defeated. Instead, the text conveys that the invention’s effect was positive, since it allowed the semiconductor industry to begin making use of mass production methods. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that the invention of the integrated circuit "bypassed" the semiconductor industry, which would mean it intentionally avoided the industry. The text indicates that the invention directly affected the semiconductor industry, since it made it possible for the industry to begin engaging in mass production methods. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the invention of the integrated circuit "obstructed" the semiconductor industry, which would mean that it blocked or hindered the industry in some way. Instead, the text indicates that the invention’s effect was positive, since it made it possible for the semiconductor industry to begin engaging in mass production methods.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how maple trees may respond to changes in climate. As used in this context, "adapt to" means to adjust to new conditions. The text first notes that maple trees already thrive in a wide variety of climates and then goes on to say that alterations maples may undergo are likely to be relatively small and easily achieved. This context supports the idea that maple trees will more easily adjust or adapt to a changing climate.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses how maple trees adjust to change, the trees do not "relocate from," or physically move from one place to another. Choice B is incorrect because "refer to" means to mention or allude to something, and the trees are not doing either of these actions. Choice C is incorrect because the text is discussing how maple trees may respond to changes in climate, not where they "originate from," or came from originally.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “singular” most nearly means extraordinary. The text portrays an experiment in which a character rehydrates a dried rose by infusing it with moisture. After prolonged contact with the liquid, the rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously “crushed and dried” petals shift, and the entire flower revives “from a deathlike slumber.” In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the flower. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “singular” can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of something, this usage doesn’t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text doesn’t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although “singular” has several related meanings, none of them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn’t portray the change undergone by the rose as necessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because “singular” means extraordinary, not acceptable. The change is portrayed as striking, not barely satisfactory. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. A person who is "dogmatic" believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true. Because Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one "unified vision" of Black American identity that they prioritize over the "diverse perspectives" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. "Proficient" means "skilled." Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different styles; they’re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. "Ambiguous" means "unclear" or "open to multiple interpretations." However, it’s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations ("diverse perspectives"). Since Du Bois and Locke are said to "diverge" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but instead clear and firm (a "unified vision"). Choice D is incorrect. "Unpretentious" means "not trying to impress others with greater skill or importance than is actually possessed." Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others).</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined question in the text as a whole. The text begins with the underlined question, “How lifelike are they?” The text then explains that many computer animators pose this question about the environments and lighting that they create for animated films, striving for realistic animation of those components even if the characters themselves aren’t portrayed in realistic terms. The focus of the text then shifts to describe how some animators strive to create environments and lighting that reflect the film’s unique stories rather than making them appear realistic. Therefore, the function of the underlined question is to reflect a primary goal that many computer animators have for certain components of the animations they produce. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because, as the text makes clear, the underlined question is one posed by computer animators who wish to create realistic backgrounds and lighting effects, not by those who, instead, wish to create effects that reflect films’ unique stories and aren’t necessarily realistic; this latter group of animators is discussed later in the text. Choice C is incorrect. As the text explains, many computer animators strive for realistic environments and lighting, while others do not; this difference of approach relates to whether these components should be realistic, not to how realism can be achieved using current technology, and the text never suggests that animators are uncertain how to achieve it. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined question pertains to the perspective of computer animators, not the audience, and the text never considers audience’s reactions to characters in animated films. </p>

          <p>The field of study called affective neuroscience seeks instinctive, physiological causes for feelings such as pleasure or displeasure. Because these sensations are linked to a chemical component (for example, the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain when one receives or expects a reward), they can be said to have a partly physiological basis. These processes have been described in mammals, but Jingnan Huang and his colleagues have recently observed that some behaviors of honeybees (such as foraging) are also motivated by a dopamine-based signaling process.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to summarize a finding suggesting that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects resemble mechanisms in mammalian brains. The text begins by explaining that feelings such as pleasure and displeasure are linked to chemical processes in the brain, such as the release of dopamine when one receives a reward. The text then indicates that such processes have been seen in mammals but that researchers have recently observed similar processes involving dopamine in honeybees. Taken together, this information serves to sum up the discovery that some mechanisms in the brains of certain insects may resemble mechanisms linked to feelings such as pleasure and displeasure in mammals. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any experiments or experimental methods. Instead, the text describes a phenomenon that has been observed in mammals and then presents the recent observations of Huang and colleagues that this phenomenon is also seen in honeybees. Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that certain insects can express how they’re feeling through particular processes. The text does indicate that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine, but it doesn’t suggest that these behaviors enable honeybees to communicate feelings or sensations. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents research showing that certain honeybee behaviors such as foraging are linked to dopamine and therefore may be motivated by similar mechanisms to those in mammalian brains, not that honeybees and mammals behave similarly when there is the possibility of reward for their actions. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of driver attitudes toward a toll increase. In this context, "receptive to" would mean open to or willing to consider something. The text focuses on drivers who think the current toll for the Lewis and Clark Bridge is too high, suggesting that advocates for increasing that toll would have better success presenting their arguments to "a more persuadable segment of the population" rather than to those drivers. This context suggests that the drivers who strongly believe the toll is already too high are not persuadable—that is, that they are unlikely to be willing to consider the toll-increase proposal.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "apprised of" means informed about or made aware of something, and nothing in the text suggests that the drivers who think a toll is already too high wouldn’t be informed of a proposal for an even higher toll; in fact, the text implies that advocates of the proposal would "direct their arguments" in favor of the increase to those drivers, even though they would likely be more successful focusing on people who are more open to hearing their arguments. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "incensed by" would mean angered or outraged by something. The text focuses on drivers who feel that a current toll is too high, and it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that those drivers would be <em>unlikely </em>to be angered by a proposal for the toll to be increased; indeed, drivers who think the toll is already too high likely would be angered by a move to raise it even higher. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "cited in" would mean referred to or mentioned in something. Although it’s reasonable to suggest that a proposal to raise a toll might not make any mention of drivers who think the toll is already too high, the text focuses on how those drivers and other people are likely to react to arguments in favor of the proposal, not on whether those drivers would be cited in the proposal itself.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how the flow of information between two regions of the brain may affect the ease of people’s decision making. In this context, "reduced" means decreased. The text presents the finding from a team of neuroeconomists that decision making may be connected to communication between the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. In presenting this finding, the text suggests a contrast between people who tend to be more decisive and people who make decisions more slowly. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between the two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. On the other hand, this context suggests that people make choices more slowly when the flow of information between the two brain regions is decreased.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "evaluated" means assessed, which wouldn’t make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people’s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to assess the information. Choice C is incorrect because "determined" means judged or influenced, neither of which would make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people’s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to judge or influence the information. Choice D is incorrect because "acquired" means developed or attained, neither of which would make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people’s ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on the development or attainment of the information.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. In this context, “surmised” means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians “assumed” that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “contrived” would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn’t supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it’s Logan and not the economic historians who “questioned,” or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians “regretted,” or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians’ emotional response to what households did in the past. </p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, “disturbed” most nearly means alarmed. The text portrays the narrator traveling in a carriage as wolves howl in the surrounding darkness. The text contrasts the reaction of both the narrator and the horses pulling the carriage with that of the driver of the carriage: the narrator and horses are “dreadfully afraid,” but the driver is “not in the least disturbed.” In other words, the driver is not alarmed by the wolves nearby. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean disorganized, the text doesn’t portray a character acting in a disorganized manner; instead, the driver continues to drive the carriage, even though the horses pulling it are alarmed. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean offended, the text doesn’t portray one character feeling offended, or upset, by another’s actions; instead, it contrasts the fear felt by the narrator with another character’s lack of fear. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “disturbed” can mean interrupted, the text doesn’t portray an action being interrupted; indeed, the travel depicted in the scene continues despite the threat of the wolves outside the carriage. </p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how Maggie Lena Walker addressed the lack of financial services available to Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. In this context, "rectify" means to correct or remedy something undesirable. The text indicates that by chartering the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank in 1903, Walker took action to provide local Black residents with greater access to financial services like home loans and savings opportunities. This context supports the idea that she aimed to rectify the undesirable situation affecting these residents.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "prolong" would mean to lengthen something in time.

The text then states that Walker founded a new bank that provided these residents with financial services. Therefore, instead of prolonging the situation, she took steps to rectify, or correct, it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "retain" would mean to continue to have or to keep something. According to the text, at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, had few formal banking options, and Walker chartered a new institution to provide these residents with expanded financial services; therefore, she took steps to rectify, not retain, the situation. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "highlight" would mean to emphasize or call attention to something, but the text indicates that Walker took concrete steps beyond merely drawing attention to the situation Black residents were facing in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. According to the text, Walker worked to rectify, or correct, the lack of formal banking options that were available to these residents by establishing a bank that provided them with home loans and savings opportunities.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is underlined, emphasizes Shakti’s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches are friendly and “welcoming,” as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that Shakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as “an old friend” of the trees. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to emphasize Shakti’s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her surroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses Shakti’s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn’t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and underlined portion emphasize Shakti’s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like “an old friend” to the woods, so she isn’t lost or confused there. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase “as an old friend” figuratively in reference to Shakti’s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her long-standing friendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, “concede” means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe “Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.” But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included “valuable objects signaling a high position of power,” which would raise the possibility that “women may have also held leadership roles.” Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “waive” means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn’t used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, “refute” means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team’s finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “require” means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age “women may have also held leadership roles.” </p>

<p> </p>
<p><span aria-level="2" class="paired_passage" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Research shows that people who don’t state their preferences when making a decision with others aren’t more likable in the eyes of others.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it directly applies the research findings described in Text 2 to the situation underlined in Text 1. The underlined sentence in Text 1 describes a common scenario in which two friends are deciding on a lunch location. Text 1 goes on to explain that people often don’t reveal their true preferences in such situations, instead claiming they’re fine with any option so that they can appear more easygoing and likable. Text 2 presents research that advises against this approach, stating that people who don’t express their preferences aren’t viewed as more likable and that this behavior actually makes decisions more difficult for others. Since Text 2 specifically argues against the strategy of concealing preferences and indicates negative outcomes from doing so, the author of Text 2 would most likely recommend stating a preference about where to eat.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that canceling plans is a good solution. The author of Text 2 is addressing how to make joint decisions effectively (through stating your own preference), not advocating for avoiding such decisions entirely. Choice B is incorrect because asking where the friend typically likes to eat still avoids stating one’s own preference. While this approach might seem considerate, it continues the pattern of not revealing true preferences that Text 2 identifies as problematic. Choice D is incorrect because changing the subject would avoid making any decision altogether, which contradicts the implied advice in Text 2. The author of Text 2 presents research suggesting that directly engaging with the decision by stating preferences helps others make decisions and makes you appear more likable.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to explain a study’s conclusion and how researchers involved in the study arrived at that conclusion. The text begins by summarizing the main conclusion of the study conducted by Paul Hanel and colleagues: when confronted with ideas they disagree with in discussions about controversial topics, people are more likely to respond politely if they think about their personal values before engaging in such discussions. The text then goes on to describe the design of Hanel and colleagues’ experiment. By comparing interactions between members of an experimental group (who had been prompted to write about their personal values beforehand) to those between members of a control group (who had been prompted to write about a beverage), the team found that people in the experimental group behaved more civilly, or politely, than people in the control group did during discussions about a controversial topic. This finding led to the conclusion described at the beginning of the text.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses the results of a study, it doesn’t provide any indication that the conclusion the study supported—that when facing disagreement, people behave more politely when they have thought about their values—is a belief that is widely held. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the researchers found the results of their study to be surprising, or contrary to what they expected. In fact, there’s no indication provided in the text about how the researchers felt about the study’s results or that the results should be considered surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text discusses the experimental design of a study, it doesn’t suggest any improvements to that design; instead, it focuses on how the design enabled the researchers to draw a particular conclusion.</p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the text’s purpose, which is to discuss the important role Barrier Williams played in supporting many other Black women as they relocated to the northern United States during the early years of the Great Migration. After introducing Barrier Williams, the text describes how she helped find jobs for other Black women, who in many cases relocated in search of better employment prospects than the South could offer at the time. The text indicates that by doing so, she eased these women’s transition as their circumstances changed. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions Barrier Williams’s work as a political activist and writer for the <em>Chicago Defender</em>, it doesn’t discuss any professional connections she made in these roles or indicate that she used any such connections in her work to secure employment for other Black women. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text discusses a factor that caused many women to relocate during the Great Migration, their difficulty finding employment in the South, the text doesn’t indicate that this factor motivated the start of the Great Migration. Moreover, the text doesn’t discuss the factors that motivated Black men to migrate. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions the difficult employment prospects for Black women in the domestic and agricultural sectors in the South during the Great Migration, the text’s main purpose isn’t to provide an overview of the employment challenges Black women faced in these sectors. Rather, it provides this information to show that Barrier Williams played a crucial role in supporting many Black women who relocated to the North by helping them achieve one of their main goals, securing a job. </p>

          <p><strong>Text 1</strong></p>
<p>In 1916, H. Dugdale Sykes disputed claims that <em>The Two Noble Kinsmen</em> was coauthored by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher. Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious—Fletcher had a distinct style in his other plays, so much so that lines with that style were considered sufficient evidence of Fletcher’s authorship. But for the lines not deemed to be by Fletcher, Sykes felt that their depiction of women indicated that their author was not Shakespeare but Philip Massinger.</p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>
<p>Scholars have accepted <em>The Two Noble Kinsmen</em> as coauthored by Shakespeare since the 1970s: it appears in all major one-volume editions of Shakespeare’s complete works. Though scholars disagree about who wrote what exactly, it is generally held that on the basis of style, Shakespeare wrote all of the first act and most of the last, while John Fletcher authored most of the three middle acts.</p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 states that Sykes felt Fletcher’s contributions to the play were obvious because he had a distinct style in his other plays. Text 2 states that scholars generally agree “on the basis of style” that Fletcher wrote most of the three middle acts. Both texts imply that Fletcher’s writing has a unique, readily identifiable style that can be used to distinguish his work from others. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While Text 1 refers to the women in Massinger plays, neither text compares the women of Fletcher’s plays to the women of Massinger’s plays. Text 2 doesn’t mention Massinger at all. Choice C is incorrect. Text 1 states that Sykes disputed that Shakespeare coauthored the play, and implied that it was coauthored by Fletcher and Massinger instead. Sykes, therefore, would disagree that <em>The Two Noble Kinsmen</em> belongs in a Shakespeare compilation. Choice D is incorrect. Text 1 doesn’t suggest that Massinger was inspired by Shakespeare, and Text 2 doesn’t mention Massinger at all. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “Involved in” means “playing an active role in.” This fits the context clues describing how Zollar includes the audience in her shows by incorporating their stories and pictures. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. “Nervous” means “worried or anxious about.” Nothing in the text suggests that people would be nervous about Zollar’s creative process. Choice B is incorrect. “Completed by” means “made whole by.” It doesn’t make sense to say that Zollar’s shows would make her audience complete. Choice C is incorrect. “Delayed by” means “made late by.” Nothing in the text suggests that people would be delayed by Zollar’s creative process. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “assumed” most nearly means acquired, or came to possess. The text portrays a character named Drowne carving a figure out of wood. At first “irregular and misty,” or haphazard and indistinct, the figure’s outline gradually showed “distincter grace and beauty” until the general design of the carved object “was now obvious to the common eye,” or plainly recognizable to anyone. In other words, as Drowne continued to carve, the wooden object came to possess, or acquired, greater precision, changing from an indistinct outline or shape into a graceful, beautiful, and clearly recognizable form. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean acknowledged, or recognized, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can’t acknowledge its own precision. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wooden figure merely imitated, or mimicked, precision. Rather, the text suggests that as Drowne carved his wooden figure, it gradually became more precise. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “assumed” can mean speculated, or supposed based on incomplete information, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because an inanimate object like the wooden figure can’t speculate about its own precision. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ester Hernandez’s art. In this context, "featured" means shown prominently. The text focuses on where Hernandez’s works have been and continue to be displayed, explaining that her early works, which consisted of murals, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San Francisco. The central contrast developed in the text is between where her early works could be viewed and where her works can be viewed now, which is in museums across the United States and around the world. The context therefore supports the idea that Hernandez’s works are now shown, or featured, in museums globally.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context "invented" would mean created something for the first time, which isn’t supported since the text doesn’t discuss where Hernandez creates her works or whether they’re original or innovative. Choice B is incorrect because "adjusted" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez’s early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez’s works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez’s works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works. Choice D is incorrect because "recommended" in this context would mean endorsed or put forth as a suggestion for something that is worth seeing. Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn’t discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez’s works. Instead, the text mainly develops a contrast between where Hernandez’s early works could once be viewed and where her work can be viewed now.</p>

          <p>Studying late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artifacts from an agricultural and domestic site in Texas, archaeologist Ayana O. Flewellen found that Black women employed as farm workers utilized hook-and-eye closures to fasten their clothes at the waist, giving themselves a silhouette similar to the one that was popular in contemporary fashion and typically achieved through more restrictive garments such as corsets. Flewellen argues that this sartorial practice shows that these women balanced hegemonic ideals of femininity with the requirements of their physically demanding occupation.</p>

The text never discusses the rate of fashion change among Black female farmworkers. The text also never categorizes Flewellen’s findings as "unexpected." Choice B is incorrect.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Hishida Shunsō’s painting <em>Cat and Plum Blossoms</em>. In this context, "embraced" means accepted or adopted readily. The text begins by identifying <em>Cat and Plum Blossoms</em> as an example of <em>Nihonga</em>, or classical (that is, traditional) Japanese painting. The text continues by drawing a contrast between Hishida’s work and Kuroda Seiki’s work, which differs from that of Hishida in its use of the traditional European method of using oil paints on canvas rather than using traditional Japanese approaches. The text then concludes with an example of one such traditional Japanese painting technique exemplified by Hishida’s <em>Cat and Plum Blossoms</em>—applications of color pigments to a silk scroll—to further develop the contrast between the two artists’ approaches. This context supports the idea that Hishida adopted, or embraced, traditional Japanese approaches.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context "distrusted" would mean that Hishida was skeptical of or lacked confidence in traditional Japanese approaches to painting. The text begins by stating that Hishida’s painting <em>Cat and Plum Blossoms</em> is an example of <em>Nihonga</em>, or traditional Japanese painting, and then cites Hishida’s application of color pigments to a silk scroll as an instance of a traditional Japanese painting technique. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that Hishida’s use of traditional Japanese painting techniques indicates his distrust, or skepticism, of them. Rather, it suggests that he embraced those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Hishida "released" traditional Japanese approaches to painting in this context would mean that he freed them from any restrictions. In using Hishida’s application of color pigments to a silk scroll in <em>Cat and Plum Blossoms</em> as an example of a traditional Japanese approach to painting found in <em>Nihonga</em>, the text strongly implies that Hishida followed these approaches, not that he removed them from any restrictions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context "overlooked" would mean ignored or failed to notice. The text establishes that Hishida’s painting <em>Cat and Plum Blossoms</em> is a notable work of <em>Nihonga</em>, or classical Japanese painting, that features the traditional technique of applying color pigments to a silk scroll. It wouldn’t make sense to say that Hishida’s use of a traditional Japanese approach to painting indicates that Hishida failed to notice those approaches.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the second sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren’t certain <em>when </em>Betelgeuse will explode because they don’t have enough information about the star’s internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse’s internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn’t be sufficient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn’t.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central finding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues’ conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insufficient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence doesn’t indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn’t address this information at all.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the conservationists’ efforts to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers. In this context, "successful" means accomplishing a goal or purpose. According to the text, conservationists planted more than 500,000 native trees in an Azores bullfinch habitat in order to boost the bird’s population size. The text then indicates that the population size did indeed grow as a result of the planted trees. Thus, in this context, the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees was successful because it achieved the goal of increasing the bird’s population size.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers was "amusing," or comical or entertaining. Instead, the approach was seriously undertaken and ultimately accomplished. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t address how much it cost to achieve the goal of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers. The text indicates that the approach was beneficial and successful rather than "costly," or expensive or harmful. Choice D is incorrect. According to the text, the conservationists’ approach of planting native trees to increase Azores bullfinch’s numbers was beneficial and successful rather than "disastrous," or damaging or unsuccessful.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of a relationship between the results of randomized clinical tests of how effective common medical interventions are and the conclusions practitioners reach about such interventions in real-world settings. In this context, "corroborate" means confirm or support with evidence. The text indicates that one possible explanation for the relationship being discussed is that practitioners may overlook confounding variables—that is, additional factors other than the medical interventions being investigated that affect the observed outcomes. This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations. In other words, clinical trials may fail to corroborate practitioners’ conclusions.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could "circumvent," or find a way around or bypass, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; it’s possible that researchers conducting the trials might avoid engaging with practitioners’ conclusions, but findings from a study can’t choose to get around something. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could "disseminate," or spread widely, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might choose to draw attention to practitioners’ conclusions, but findings from a study can’t spread anything. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could "implement," or put into effect, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might consider practitioners’ conclusions, but findings from a study can’t put anything into effect.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of business marketing practices. In this context, "optimize" means make the most effective possible use of available opportunities. The text indicates that though businesses typically try to promote themselves, they don’t always make use of effective tools for doing so, pointing to research showing that 33 percent of restaurants failed to use a free listing service that increased revenue by 5 percent on average for restaurants that did use the service. The text therefore suggests that by foregoing a free and effective marketing tool, some businesses aren’t making the best use of, or optimizing, marketing opportunities.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "adorn" would mean decorate or enhance the appearance of, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that by failing to use a free and effective promotional tool, some businesses aren’t enhancing the appearance of their own marketing. The example in the text illustrates that some businesses aren’t utilizing an effective marketing opportunity, not that they aren’t improving the appearance of their marketing. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "endorse" would mean openly approve or recommend, and the text’s discussion of the fact that some businesses have overlooked an effective marketing tool doesn’t support the idea that those businesses therefore don’t approve of their own marketing. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, saying that businesses don’t "counteract" their marketing would suggest that they don’t actively undermine it or make it ineffective. The text begins by stating that businesses typically try to promote themselves but then continues to imply that some businesses fail to take advantage of good opportunities to do so, citing the example of businesses that failed to use a free and effective marketing tool. Though it’s possible that those businesses that did use the site therefore didn’t unintentionally counteract their own marketing, the first sentence conveys that the text’s focus is on things that some businesses do and that some businesses don’t do when trying to promote themselves, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that any businesses would actively try to undermine their own marketing in pursuit of that goal.</p>

As used in this context, “speculates” would mean puts forward an idea without firm evidence.

Choice D is incorrect because  saying that Ochoa “establishes,” or proves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth’s would not make sense in context.

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the <em>W</em> boson. In this context, "scale" means size or extent. The text indicates that recent measurements of the <em>W</em> boson were remarkable because they revealed the subatomic particle’s mass to be much greater ("seven standard deviations higher") than had been expected based on a standard model. This context conveys not only that the measurements differed from predictions but also that the extent of the difference was very large.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that there was a very large difference between the predicted mass and the actual measured mass of the subatomic particle, it doesn’t explain the cause of, or reason behind, that difference. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the measurements of the subatomic particle were notable because they differed from expectations and also because a difference existed between the measurements and what had been predicted; the text would be repeating the idea that there was a difference instead of adding to that idea. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t convey any implications of, or consequences of or conclusions drawn from, the fact that the mass of the subatomic particle differed from expectations; the context indicates only that the actual measured mass was much higher than the predicted mass.</p>

In the text, the narrator conveys that the task of translating a novel has been an all-consuming one and that she hopes things will "be normal again" once she has "sent off the manuscript." In other words, the narrator is looking forward to finishing her work on the manuscript and returning to other things.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "completing" doesn’t mean destroying, or ruining.

Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "completing" doesn’t mean advertising, or publicly promoting. The narrator addresses her complete focus on the translation and her hope that things will be "normal again" once she has "sent off the manuscript," conveying that she is looking forward to finishing the task, not to promoting the resulting manuscript. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "completing" doesn’t mean rejecting, or refusing or repelling. The narrator makes it clear that she is absorbed in working on the translation and plans to send off the manuscript, suggesting that instead of refusing to do the work, she is continuing to do it (even if she looks forward to things being "normal again" when she’s done).</p>

Fowler argues that requiring citizens to vote leads to a significant increase in voters who would otherwise not have the time or motivation to vote. Thus, election results in countries that require citizens to vote better reflect the preferences of the country as a whole. </p>

<p>Governments in democratic countries function better when more people vote. However, forcing people to vote may have negative consequences. Shane P. Singh and Jason Roy studied what happens when a country requires its citizens to vote. They found that when people feel forced to vote, they tend to spend less time looking for information about their choices when voting. As a result, votes from these voters may not reflect their actual preferences.</p>
          <p>Based on the texts, how would Singh and Roy (Text 2) most likely respond to the research discussed in Text 1?</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. Text 1 claims that mandatory voting results in elections that "better reflect the preferences of the country." Singh and Roy disagree. They claim that more voters doesn’t equal more quality votes—instead, they argue that forced voting may lead to less-informed votes that "may not reflect [voters’] actual preferences."</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Neither text mentions the population size of countries that require voting, or how that might affect election outcomes. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text discusses the effects of mandatory voting on other forms of political engagement. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text discusses the ease or difficulty of the voting process in countries that require voting.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Theia and the origin of the Moon. In this context, "notional" means theoretical or only an idea. The text indicates that although something was once true of Theia, the protoplanet one theory holds collided with Earth and created debris that became the Moon, researchers now claim to have identified pieces of it deep in Earth’s mantle. In other words, having direct evidence of Theia is a new development. This context suggests that before evidence was found, Theia was only theoretical—that is, that it was notional.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Theia, a protoplanet, was "desultory," which in this context would mean moving away from the matter at hand; indeed, the text focuses on the "big whack" theory of the origin of the Moon and indicates that Theia is a central part of that theory. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes the point that something was true of Theia until recently and suggests that this has changed now that researchers believe they have found pieces of the protoplanet deep in Earth’s mantle. It wouldn’t make sense to say that Theia was actually "spurious," or false, until researchers found direct evidence of the protoplanet. (Although Theia’s existence might not have been certain, it would not have been false simply because there was no evidence of it.) Choice C is incorrect because the text makes the point that something was true of Theia until recently and suggests that this has changed now that researchers believe they have found pieces of the protoplanet deep in Earth’s mantle. It wouldn’t make sense to say that Theia was "veritable," or real, before researchers found direct evidence of its existence: the evidence would instead confirm that Theia was real.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Renata Flores Rivera’s use of Quechua in her music. In this context, “inexperienced with” means not accustomed to. The text indicates that Flores Rivera wanted to promote the Quechua language in her music and overcame a challenge by seeking help with pronunciation from her grandmother and by taking language classes. This context conveys the idea that Flores Rivera was not sufficiently familiar with Quechua to use it in her music without help. Thus, she was inexperienced with speaking the language, which she addressed by seeking help. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because describing Flores Rivera as “prepared for”—or ready for—speaking Quechua wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were ready to speak the language, then there would be no challenge.

The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were capable of speaking the language, then there would be no challenge. Choice D is incorrect. Flores Rivera was likely “excited about”—or thrilled or delighted with—speaking Quechua, but this wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that speaking Quechua presented a challenge, but if she were delighted with speaking the language, then there would be no challenge. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about people’s tendency to dismiss claims from sources perceived as self-interested, or acting for their own advantage. In this context, "irrelevant" means not applicable to the matter at hand. The text explains that as a matter of logical reasoning, the source of a claim has nothing to do with the claim’s truthfulness—a claim is either true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. This context suggests that even though people may distrust a claim based on its source, the source of the claim is actually irrelevant.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "indistinct" would mean uncertain or not clearly recognizable. Instead of suggesting that the source of a claim can’t be determined with certainty, the text suggests that recognizing a source and having an opinion of it simply doesn’t matter because as a matter of logic, a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "indisputable" would mean impossible to question or deny. Although the text suggests that it isn’t logical to assume a claim is false just because its source appears to be self-interested, it doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the source of a claim can’t be questioned—the text instead makes the point that from a logical standpoint, the source of a claim doesn’t matter because the claim is either true or false in and of itself. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "implicit" would mean suggested or understood without being directly expressed. Nothing in the text suggests that logically, the source of a claim is only suggested; instead of addressing whether sources can be directly identified, the text focuses on the idea that sources don’t matter because a claim is true or false in actuality, regardless of where it originates.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sterlin Harjo’s approach to representing Native characters on television. As used in this context, “repudiates” means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo’s series <em>Reservation Dogs</em> focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a “rejection” of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo’s “rejection” of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo “proclaims,” or declares or affirms, television’s general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television’s tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo “foretells,” or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo’s “rejection” of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo “recants” something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that Harjo recants television’s tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned. Additionally, a tendency isn’t a belief and thus isn’t something that can be recanted. </p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “spread” most nearly means extended. The text states that the zoo is “huge,” that it covers “numberless acres,” and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text’s emphasis on the zoo’s size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers “numberless acres,” then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or concealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or talked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo’s large size. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “spread” can mean coated, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid substance, such as oil or paint, to a surface. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that the zoo coated the acres on which it sits.  </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of damage to viburnum plants. In this context, “healthy” would mean not distressed or diseased. The text states that insect damage may cause viburnum plants to be discolored and have abnormal growths. In the next sentence, the phrase “on the other hand” indicates a contrast with the description of plants suffering from damage. Thus, the context contrasts the appearance of healthy, undamaged plants with the appearance of damaged plants. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “struggling” would mean working against difficulties. The text first describes viburnum plants experiencing damage by insects, and the phrase “on the other hand” then establishes a contrast with that description. It wouldn’t make sense to contrast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged by insects, because in both cases the plants would be experiencing difficulties. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “beneficial” would mean producing good or helpful effects. The text doesn’t discuss how viburnum plants affect other things or suggest that the plants are helpful in some way; rather, it focuses on how viburnum plants are affected by certain conditions. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “simple” would mean plain or uncomplicated. The text doesn’t discuss whether certain viburnum plants are complicated or uncomplicated; rather, it focuses on how viburnum plants are affected by certain conditions. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The text discusses the Bayeux Tapestry, making the point that the workers who produced the huge tapestry in the eleventh century might not have ever produced a tapestry so large before. The text goes on to suggest that because of this lack of previous experience, the workers developed and refined the process of joining the tapestry’s panels over time as they worked. The last sentence of the text then provides an example of an observation that suggests the workers’ process changed: clear misalignment of the borders of the two panels the workers joined first and virtually invisible joins completed later. Thus, the underlined sentence serves to support an argument about the workers who produced the tapestry.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the example given in the last sentence of the text has to do with how the panels of the Bayeux Tapestry were joined by the workers, not with what is depicted in those panels; the text never identifies any people or places depicted in the tapestry. Choice C is incorrect because the last sentence compares how early panels in the Bayeux Tapestry were joined with how later panels in the same tapestry were joined; it doesn’t make any comparison between the Bayeux Tapestry and other tapestries from the same time in France. Choice D is incorrect because the last sentence doesn’t address the location where the Bayeux Tapestry was created; the first sentence of the text presents it as a given that the tapestry was created in France, but nothing in the text indicates how that origin was determined.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Moon’s surface. In this context, “reflect” means show or make apparent. The text states that because the surface of the Moon was softer when the Moon was still forming than it is now, early asteroid and meteoroid impacts “would have left less of an impression” and, as a result, evidence of them may no longer exist. This context supports the idea that the surface of the Moon may not accurately show signs of early impact events. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “receive,” or acquire or experience, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids. The text indicates that the impacts have already occurred, and it isn’t clear how the Moon’s surface could be accurate or inaccurate in experiencing them. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately “evaluate,” or determine the significance or condition of, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon’s surface to make a decision of any kind. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “mimic” would mean to deliberately simulate or closely imitate something. It wouldn’t make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately mimic early asteroid and meteoroid impacts, since that would suggest that it’s possible for the Moon to deliberately imitate something. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “contracted” most nearly means developed. The text explains that Mr. Brooke has a “too rambling habit of mind,” which the text likens to a disease, saying he is thought to have contracted it. To contract a disease means to acquire or develop a disease. In other words, the text indicates that Mr. Brooke is believed to have acquired, or developed, the habit of mind described in the text. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although “contracted” can mean limited or restricted in some contexts, here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this “too rambling habit of mind,” not that it has been somehow limited or restricted. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text describes Mr. Brooke’s habit of mind, nothing suggests that those are his descriptions or, indeed, that he described his habit of mind at all. Choice D is incorrect because settled means calmed or mitigated, but here Mr. Brooke is said to draw unpredictable conclusions, suggesting that he exhibits this “too rambling habit of mind,” not that it has been somehow calmed or mitigated. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of historical evidence about ancient Egypt under the reign of the pharaoh Hatshepsut. In this context, "an exhaustive" account would be a thorough one. The text states that much of the evidence from her reign was purposely destroyed—in other words, there is a lack of surviving records. This context conveys that unless there are major new archaeological discoveries, an exhaustive account of Hatshepsut’s reign is unlikely.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "an imaginative" account would be an account based on imagination, or ideas and speculation, rather than facts. The text indicates that much of the evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign was deliberately destroyed, and a lack of evidence actually makes it more likely that accounts will be imaginative to some degree and not strictly factual. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "a superficial" account would be one that is lacking in depth or concerned only with what is obvious. The text indicates that most evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign was purposely destroyed, which suggests that accounts of that time are likely already somewhat superficial, since there is little information available to support deeper knowledge. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because "a questionable" account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut’s reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be questionable.</p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it describes how the underlined portion of the sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text begins by discussing ordinary soap bubbles, objects that usually exist for less than a minute before popping due to either evaporation or gravity-induced drainage. The text then goes on to mention work by researchers Aymeric Roux and colleagues, who have discovered how to increase the longevity of bubbles by altering their chemical composition. Finally, the underlined portion of the text describes how this process works: since the bubble contains both water and glycerol, it can draw water molecules from the surrounding air to replace those lost to evaporation. Therefore, the underlined portion of the sentence describes the effects of a process devised by researchers that increases the longevity of an object described in the text.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the circumstance that prompted the research is discussed in the first sentence of the text, not the underlined portion. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text does not address why soap bubbles must eventually rupture. Rather, it explains how the longevity of soap bubbles can be extended. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text does not mention any future experiments.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Octavia Butler’s career. In this context, “impenetrable” means impossible to enter. The text indicates that the field of science fiction was dominated by white males when Butler, a Black woman, started writing, but she published several science fiction short stories and a novel and later won a prestigious award; that is, Butler pursued science fiction writing and had success. This context suggests that Butler didn’t view the genre as impossible to enter. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “legitimate” would mean genuinely good or valid. Nothing in the text suggests that Butler didn’t think the science fiction genre was good or valid; in fact, it indicates that she pursued and made a successful career of publishing work in that field. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, “compelling” would mean attracting or demanding attention. The text indicates that Butler chose to write science fiction, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that she didn’t see the field as drawing her attention. Choice D is incorrect. To say that Butler didn’t consider science fiction “indecipherable,” or impossible to understand, would suggest that Butler did understand it. However, the text doesn’t address Butler’s ability to interpret works in the genre; rather, it focuses on Butler’s successful pursuit of writing science fiction. </p>

This matches the text’s description of noses on ancient sculptures, which are often missing from sculptures’ heads because they are "especially easy to break." Therefore, this context indicates that noses on ancient sculptures are the most fragile part of the sculptures’ heads.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "recognizable" would mean identifiable, and since the text indicates that noses are often missing from ancient statues, they therefore cannot be the most recognizable part of the statue. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many ancient statues are missing noses, so noses wouldn’t be "common," or frequent, aspects of ancient statues; they would conversely be uncommon. Choice D is incorrect because the text only indicates that noses on ancient statues often stick out and end up missing from the heads, which doesn’t relate to the noses being "sophisticated," or knowledgeable or refined.</p>

<p>Growth in the use of novel nanohybrids—materials created from the conjugation of multiple distinct nanomaterials, such as iron oxide and gold nanomaterials conjugated for use in magnetic imaging—has outpaced studies of nanohybrids’ environmental risks. Unfortunately, risk evaluations based on nanohybrids’ constituents are not reliable: <u>conjugation may alter constituents’ physiochemical properties such that innocuous nanomaterials form a nanohybrid that is anything but</u>.</p>
<p>Text 2</p>
<p>The potential for enhanced toxicity of nanohybrids relative to the toxicity of constituent nanomaterials has drawn deserved attention, but the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case. For instance, it was recently shown that a nanohybrid of silicon dioxide and zinc oxide preserved the desired optical transparency of zinc oxide nanoparticles while mitigating the nanoparticles’ potential to damage DNA.</p>
          <p>Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assertion in the underlined portion of Text 1?</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 acknowledges that nanohybrids may be more toxic than their constituent parts, but also provides an example of a nanohybrid that has reduced toxicity compared to its components: silicon dioxide and zinc oxide together have all the benefits of zinc oxide nanoparticles without any of the DNA harm zinc oxide has on its own. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 gives an example of a nanohybrid that isn’t as toxic as its constituent parts, they don’t argue that the benefit outweighs the risk. They merely argue that “the effects of nanomaterial conjugation vary by case.” Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 states that the effects of nanomaterial conjugation “vary by case,” and that the attention that their potential toxicity has drawn is warranted. If the situation in Text 1 weren’t representative, then there would be less attention to the potential danger of these materials. Furthermore, neither passage suggests that researchers had expected that they could predict the effects of nanomaterial conjugation. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 agrees that the potential toxicity of nanohybrids “has drawn deserved attention,” so they aren’t denying the problem. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text, which is to convey the speaker’s longing for the ocean to impart a sense of inner tranquility, or peace. The text begins by expressing the speaker’s strong desire to be on the ocean, appealing directly to the waves to rock the speaker to sleep. The poem then describes the "slumberous lullaby" formed by the sound of the waves and the winds on which the speaker wishes to be carried "gently...between a peaceful sea and sky." All these details serve to emphasize the speaker’s desire for the ocean to give them a sense of inner tranquility.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Given the poem’s expression of a longing to achieve tranquility by drifting on the ocean, it can be inferred that the speaker desires to escape something unpleasant in daily life. However, the poem doesn’t refer directly to any such hardship—ongoing or otherwise. And since the poem doesn’t establish that the speaker is experiencing a desire to escape ongoing hardship, it can’t be said that such a desire increases in intensity. Choice B is incorrect. The speaker does express a desire for the serenity of being rocked to sleep by the ocean, and it can be inferred that this desire is a response to demands that make the speaker’s daily life stressful. However, the poem doesn’t refer directly to such demands or contrast them with the tranquility of drifting on the ocean. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest the speaker has any qualms, or reservations, about being transported by the ocean. On the contrary, the speaker actively desires to "drift far out" and be carried by the waves and wind. Moreover, the poem doesn’t suggest that this drifting would have any particular destination.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text, which is to describe a collection of medieval maps and how it was created. The text begins by mentioning Muhammad al-Idrisi’s collection of maps of lands known to medieval Arabic and European scholars. It then states that the Norman king Roger II hired al-Idrisi to create the collection and details al-Idrisi’s methods of creation: consulting Arabic and Greek maps and interviewing travelers. In short, the text presents a collection of medieval maps and then goes on to describe how that collection came to be.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text describes a collection of maps and the process of creating that collection but does not discuss the benefits of studying mapmaking in general. Choice B is incorrect because though the text mentions that al-Idrisi interviewed travelers, the text does not describe how those travelers created maps. Choice D is incorrect because though the text mentions that al-Idrisi consulted Arabic and Greek maps, the text does not offer a comparison of Arabic and Greek mapmaking techniques.</p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text says that the increased production quotas of food processing companies during World War II enabled employees to make better bargains in exchange for their labor. The underlined portion presents an example of this increased bargaining power: employees requested more favorable benefits, and employers complied because they were under pressure to fulfill the demanding terms of their contracts. Thus, the underlined portion of the text elaborates on a claim about labor relations in a particular industry (food processing) made earlier in the text. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that the economic factors that influenced food processing also influenced other parts of the economy; thus, the bargaining described in the underlined portion of the text cannot be called an example of a trend. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion supports the historical narrative of labor activism in food processing that is sketched in the text, instead of noting an exception to that narrative. Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined portion does discuss the demands that workers made in exchange for their labor, it does not discuss the identities of the workers. </p>

This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is “involuntarily framing advertisements” (meaning that she can’t stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new “situations” (or jobs) would be like. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane’s feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornfield Hall. And rather than emphasizing that Jane feels particularly loyal to her employers, the text focuses on her constant consideration of leaving her job. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane finds her current situation fulfilling, or satisfying. Given that much of the text is focused on Jane’s thoughts about possibly leaving her job for a new one, it might be the case that she finds her situation challenging, but there is no evidence in the text that Jane also finds that situation satisfying—she says nothing positive about her current job at all, in fact. Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to definitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she “should” quit her current job (indicating that she hasn’t yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could find, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts “might germinate and bear fruit if they could,” meaning that the thoughts haven’t yet led to a decision—that Jane isn’t yet determined to get a new job somewhere else. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ulysses Jenkins’s video art. As used in this context, “newfound” means recently discovered or established. The text indicates that in the 1970s, video cameras became cheaper and therefore more widely available than they had been in the past. The text goes on to say that this development provided Jenkins and other artists with capabilities that they previously didn’t have. As a result, Jenkins began producing groundbreaking works of video art. This context supports the idea that Jenkins took advantage of newfound access to video cameras. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because “delicate” means fine in texture or structure or easily broken, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text doesn’t focus on describing what video art looks like or whether it’s breakable. Choice C is incorrect because “inevitable” means impossible to avoid, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text doesn’t discuss the likelihood of artists, or anyone else, gaining access to video cameras. Choice D is incorrect because “habitual” means doing something regularly or repeatedly. Although the text does suggest that Jenkins created multiple pieces of video art, its focus is on the fact that video cameras had only just become widely available to artists in the 1970s. Jenkins’s ability to take advantage of video cameras to make art was therefore newfound, not habitual, at the time. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text establishes that many countries have adopted risk-disclosure requirements for financial products due to concerns that consumers don’t understand the risks associated with the products. According to the text, Seira et al. found that the effects of such messaging on consumer behavior were small and temporary. The text then adds that the researchers assert that because the cost of the messaging is negligible, the approach may be worth doing even if the effects are limited. Thus, the underlined portion notes a factor—very low cost—that led the researchers to not completely dismiss risk-disclosure messaging despite their evidence of its limited utility.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t refer to a particular type of risk-disclosure messaging, whether Seira et al. considered it or not; the underlined portion simply indicates that the cost of the messaging (broadly) is very low, which makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion does describe a consideration that led the researchers to recommend risk-disclosure messaging despite the messaging’s small effects on consumer behavior, it directly states that the cost of such messaging is negligible, or very low—meaning that both the effects and the costs are small, not that the effects are small only relative to the costs. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no indication that Seira et al. suggest that risk-disclosure messaging could be more effective if it had lower costs; rather, the underlined portion indicates that Seira et al. believe the already negligible cost of messaging makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited.</p>

          <p><strong>Text 1</strong></p>
<p>Africa’s Sahara region—once a lush ecosystem—began to dry out about 8,000 years ago. A change in Earth’s orbit that affected climate has been posited as a cause of desertification, but archaeologist David Wright also attributes the shift to Neolithic peoples. He cites their adoption of pastoralism as a factor in the region drying out: the pastoralists’ livestock depleted vegetation, prompting the events that created the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>
<p>Research by Chris Brierley et al. challenges the idea that Neolithic peoples contributed to the Sahara’s desertification. Using a climate-vegetation model, the team concluded that the end of the region’s humid period occurred 500 years earlier than previously assumed. The timing suggests that Neolithic peoples didn’t exacerbate aridity in the region but, in fact, may have helped delay environmental changes with practices (e.g., selective grazing) that preserved vegetation.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. Brierley et al.’s research directly challenges Wright’s claim that pastoralism turned the Sahara into a desert, suggesting that, in a Sahara that turned arid 500 years earlier than previously thought, pastoral practices may have actually “preserved vegetation” rather than depleting it. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research actually disputes the idea that any Neolithic peoples’ behaviors, including pastoralism, could have contributed to the Sahara’s changing climate. In fact, their research implies that the Neolithic peoples’ practices did not “exacerbate aridity” (i.e., make things worse), but may have slowed environmental changes. Choice C is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not acknowledge that pastoralism can have deleterious (i.e., negative) effects on a region’s vegetation and climate. It only describes one possible beneficial effect: preserving vegetation through practices like selective grazing. Choice D is incorrect. Brierley et al.’s research does not call for more research into factors that likely contributed to the desertification of the Sahara region. </p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the first sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence introduces what yawn contagion is, explaining that it occurs when an individual yawns in response to the yawn of another individual. The text goes on to describe Elisabetta Palagi and her colleagues’ study of this phenomenon in a wild population of gelada monkeys. According to the text, the study showed that wild primate populations experience yawn contagion and that the behavior occurs most commonly in male monkeys and across social groups. Thus, the function of the first sentence is to define the phenomenon of yawn contagion that is discussed in the text. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the first sentence introduces the text’s discussion of yawn contagion, it doesn’t present this behavior, or anything else, as a problem. Choice C is incorrect because the first sentence doesn’t present a claim but instead explains what yawn contagion is. Moreover, the text doesn’t challenge anything; it’s an informative text that describes the findings of a research study about yawning in wild primate populations. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes a scientific study, and most scientific studies are guided by a hypothesis, the text doesn’t say what Palagi and her colleagues’ hypothesis was; the text discusses their findings instead. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of self-control in cuttlefish. In this context, "competent" means capable. The text describes a study in which cuttlefish demonstrated an ability to exercise restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of eating a meal that was already available to them. That is, by delaying gratification, the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated that they were capable of, or competent at, exercising self-control.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that in demonstrating self-control, cuttlefish are "awkward," or lacking skill or grace. If anything, the text indicates that cuttlefish appear to be surprisingly skilled at exercising self-control. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "imaginative" would mean creative, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that cuttlefish demonstrate creativity. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that cuttlefish seem to be capable of exercising restraint and self-control. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "manageable" would mean capable of being controlled. Although the text indicates that the cuttlefish in the study demonstrated restraint by waiting for a favorite treat instead of devouring a readily available meal (which suggests their ability to control themselves), it doesn’t suggest that cuttlefish are thus also able to be managed or controlled by others.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of residential mobility decisions. In this context, "mediated by" means influenced or affected by something. The text establishes that increasing household spending power (an economic factor) produced "mixed effects" on mobility decisions. The text then explains that residential choices are "not fully reducible to economic factors," which means that these decisions don’t simply rely on how much money is available to spend on a residential move but on other factors as well. According to the text, noneconomic considerations, such as access to social networks, also play a significant role. Thus, "mediated by" accurately captures this relationship where noneconomic factors influence what might otherwise be purely economic decisions.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "transposed with" would suggest that economic and noneconomic factors are being switched or interchanged when making residential mobility decisions, which wouldn’t make logical sense in this context. The text indicates that these factors coexist and jointly influence such decisions. Choice C is incorrect. The phrase "decoupled from" means separated or disconnected from, which would suggest that economic factors are completely separate from noneconomic factors. This would contradict the text’s main point that residential mobility decisions involve multiple factors being considered simultaneously rather than in isolation. Choice D is incorrect because "antecedent to," which means something prior or earlier, would indicate that noneconomic factors come before economic ones in time or sequence. The text doesn’t establish this chronological relationship. Instead, the text indicates that economic factors (household spending power) and noneconomic factors (access to social networks) simultaneously influence residential mobility decisions.</p>

<p>Soy sauce, made from fermented soybeans, is noted for its umami flavor. Umami—one of the five basic tastes along with sweet, bitter, salty, and sour—was formally classified when its taste receptors were discovered in the 2000s. In 2007, to define the pure umami flavor scientists Rie Ishii and Michael O’Mahony used broths made from shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed, and two panels of Japanese and US judges closely agreed on a description of the taste.</p>

<p>A 2022 experiment by Manon Jünger et al. led to a greater understanding of soy sauce’s flavor profile. The team initially presented a mixture of compounds with low molecular weights to taste testers who found it was not as salty or bitter as real soy sauce. Further analysis of soy sauce identified proteins, including dipeptides, that enhanced umami flavor and also contributed to saltiness. The team then made a mix of 50 chemical compounds that re-created soy sauce’s flavor.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. Ishii and O’Mahony were trying to isolate the pure umami flavor, while Jünger was trying to recreate soy sauce, which has a mix of flavors that includes umami. Accordingly, the broths from Text 1 are not described as having any soy sauce in them—just “shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed.” So they probably don’t have as much of the dipeptides described in Text 2, which were found to be a key part of soy sauce’s umami-ness and its saltiness. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Neither text gets into the diets of people in the United States, nor the diets of people in Japan. Choice B is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Text 2 does talk about the molecular weights of chemical compounds, but there isn’t enough information provided about molecular weights in Text 1 to make an inference about what the scientists in Text 1 would say. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text supports this. Text 1 briefly mentions that soy sauce is “made from fermented soybeans,” but it never claims that fermentation is responsible for its flavor in any way. And Text 2 never mentions fermentation at all. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Olga Tokarczuk’s novel <em>The Books of Jacob</em>. As used in this context, “complexity” means having many complicated parts that when taken as a whole are difficult to follow or explain. The text indicates that <em>The Books of Jacob</em> has a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot (that is, a plot that is difficult to follow), and reverse page numbering. Together, these features make up a novel that’s challenging to read and summarize. This context supports the idea that a brief book review can’t do justice to the novel’s complexity. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “accuracy,” or being free from error or falsehood, can sometimes be used to describe a novel, the text doesn’t discuss whether Tokarczuk’s novel has this quality. Instead, the text describes the novel as having a large cast of characters, a difficult-to-follow plot, and reverse page numbering. These features suggest complexity, not accuracy. Choice B is incorrect because “inactivity” means being in a state of idleness or doing nothing, neither of which would make sense in this context. The text describes Tokarczuk’s novel, and although it’s possible the novel could portray its characters as inactive, it wouldn’t make sense to describe the novel itself as such. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “restraint” would mean holding back or showing self-control, and the text doesn’t indicate that Tokarczuk’s novel has either of these qualities. In fact, the features of the novel that the text describes, such as a large cast of characters, a complicated and wandering plot, and reverse page numbering, suggest excess and complexity, not restraint. </p>

<p>Dance choreographer Alvin Ailey’s deep admiration for jazz music can most clearly be felt in the rhythms and beats his works were set to.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about microbes with which Fierer’s team (Text 1) and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree. Text 1 states that microbes usually thrive in very harsh conditions, and so Fierer’s team was surprised when samples collected from an extremely cold and dry area of Antarctica didn’t appear to contain any life. Fierer’s team says that though this doesn’t conclusively prove there are no microbes in the area, it suggests that microbes would have a notably difficult time surviving in the environment. The author of Text 2 says it’s unlikely that there would be no microbes at all in the Antarctic study site from which Fierer’s team retrieved soil samples and that there may have been hard-to-detect microbes in the samples. However, the presence of only a few microbes in the Antarctic samples rather than the billions found in a typical soil sample (which would presumably be much easier to detect) would illustrate conditions in the Antarctic soil that make it difficult for microbes to thrive. Since Fierer’s team says that the seeming absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples suggests an unusually harsh environment and the author of Text 2 says that even if there are a few undetectable microbes in the samples, the relatively tiny number of microbes would also suggest an unusually harsh environment, then Fierer’s team and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree that most microbes are unable to withstand the soil conditions at the Antarctic study site. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The samples taken by Fierer’s team were from an area of Antarctica that is described in part as extremely dry, and these samples didn’t appear to have any life. Therefore, even though these samples also came from an extremely cold area, Fierer’s team wouldn’t argue based on the evidence available that microbes were better able to survive in dry conditions than in areas with harsh temperatures. Moreover, the author of Text 2 says that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth but doesn’t compare dry environments and harsh environments. Choice B is incorrect. Nothing in Text 1 indicates that another collection of samples from the Antarctic study site might yield different results from the samples already taken by Fierer’s team. The author of Text 2 does state that microbes are found in virtually every environment on Earth and suggests that new technology may be better able to detect so few microbes in a soil sample, but the author of Text 2 concludes that the unusual absence of microbes in the Antarctic samples is evidence of the harsh Antarctic environment. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the author of Text 2 thinks that another sample drawn from that same harsh environment would yield a much higher number of microbes. Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does speculate that there may have been so few microbes in the Antarctic samples that current technology couldn’t detect them, but the author doesn’t speculate that this is due to the size of the microbes. Moreover, nothing that Fierer’s team says suggests that they are speculating that their samples might have microbes that are smaller than microbes in typical soil samples. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “beckoning” most nearly means “inviting,” or attractive. The text portrays a woman who is looking at “trees in their spring beauty.” She compares them to cities, which have their own pleasures even if they do not have the “easy unhuman loveliness” of trees: she thinks of cities as “seductive” and “charming,” both adjectives that signify something that is enticing, or attractive. Therefore, cities that are seductive and charming would also be described as inviting people closer to them. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in this context that cities are “demanding,” or requiring effort. Choice B is incorrect. Though “signaling,” or communicating something, might be considered a key feature of the act of “beckoning,” in the context here, “beckoning” suggests that cities have attractive qualities that naturally draw people to them. Such attractive qualities are not described by the word “signaling” alone. Therefore, “signaling” is an incorrect answer because it is insufficiently precise. Choice D is incorrect because there is no reason to think in this context that the cities are “shifting,” or changing shape. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. Trever thinks that the “hyper-realistic portrayal of identifiable people” interpretation ignores the sculptors’ imagination and creativity. We can infer that Trevor thinks the facial markings on the sculptures may not have represented real skin blemishes on real people. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text compares the depictions of human faces to the depictions of plants or animals, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice B is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. There’s nothing in either text about multiple depictions representing the same person, so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. Choice C is incorrect. The text gives us no reason to think that Trever would respond to the underlined interpretation in this way. Neither text mentions the state of the vessels (damaged or intact), so we have no basis to draw this conclusion. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the creation of <em>The Adventures of Prince Achmed.</em> In this context, "arduous" means that the process is marked by great labor or effort. According to the text, the creation of the 1926 animated film <em>The Adventures of Prince Achmed</em> took three years and was a painstaking process. Since the process was so long and required great efforts by Lotte Reiniger and her team, the creation of the film was therefore an arduous process.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that the creation of Reiniger’s film was "a haphazard," or disorganized, process. In fact, the text suggests that the creation process was quite meticulous and the team worked hard together to produce the envisioned effects. Choice B is incorrect. While the text does suggest that the creation of Reiniger’s film was a long and difficult process, it doesn’t suggest that the process was "a contentious" one, or one causing controversy or argument. The text suggests that the team worked together to produce the envisioned effects. Choice C is incorrect because rather than describing the process of creating the film as "ineffectual," or not having the effect it was intended to have, the text describes the process as ultimately successful despite the difficulty it involved.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. “Spans” means “extends over a distance of” or “encompasses.” Since we’re talking about the world’s largest plant, it makes sense to say that it “spans” about 200 square kilometers. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. “Acknowledges” means “recognizes” or “admits the truth of.” Either way, it doesn’t make sense here: a plant can’t “acknowledge” a distance. Choice B is incorrect. “Produces” can mean “makes,” “causes,” or “presents.” But none of those definitions make sense here: a plant can’t make, cause, or present a distance. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn’t fit the logic of the text. “Advances” means “moves forward” or “progresses.” But the plant isn’t necessarily moving forward. Rather, the text suggests that it already covers a distance of 200 square kilometers. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text indicates that Johnson returned to the US in 1938 at which time his painting style suddenly changed. The second sentence is underlined and gives more detail about this stylistic change, noting that his earlier work consisted largely of landscapes in an expressionist style and his new works were highly stylized portraits of Black Americans. In other words, the function of the underlined sentence is to elaborate on a transitional moment in Johnson’s painting career.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does mention that Johnson spent a decade in Europe, it does not discuss what other travel Johnson might have done. Furthermore, although the text mentions African, American, and Scandinavian artistic elements in Johnson’s work, it does not indicate that he traveled to different locations to learn about these practices. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not focus on Johnson’s personal life nor does it address how successful his career was in general. Choice D is incorrect because, rather than call it into question, the underlined sentence continues the discussion of Johnson’s career by adding further relevant detail of Johnson’s artistic transformation.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months’ work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer’s dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was "brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch," he also possessed "a singular patience and mildness." In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel’s personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel’s occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text—that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the writing system created by Sequoyah. In this context, “widespread” means widely accepted or practiced. The text indicates that because Sequoyah’s script accurately represented the spoken sounds of the Cherokee language and was easy to learn, nearly all Cherokee people were able to read and write it soon after it was created. This context demonstrates that the script was widely used by the Cherokee people. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. In this context, “careful” would mean exercised with care and attentive concern. Although the work of creating a writing system likely involved great care, the text indicates that the system was “easy to learn,” which conflicts with the idea that using this system requires a noteworthy amount of care. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “unintended” means not deliberate. The idea that using Sequoyah’s script was unintentional conflicts directly with the claim that it was easy to learn and used by “over 90% of the Cherokee people” by 1830. In fact, because one had to learn this system, it’s not clear how one could use it unintentionally. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “infrequent” means rare or not occurring often, which conflicts directly with the claim that “over 90% of the Cherokee people” were using Sequoyah’s script by 1830. </p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents the best description of the overall structure of the text. The text begins by stating that companies are increasingly giving consumers opportunities to customize products, allowing them to make design choices when buying certain sneakers, jewelry, and clothing. The text then indicates that although this trend benefits companies because they can successfully charge buyers more for customized products and don’t have to rush production, it also poses a challenge because producing unique items may require different and more expensive methods than the ones typically used for mass production, raising the companies’ costs. Thus, the text first introduces a trend in consumer products and then explains how the trend both benefits and poses a challenge to companies.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t present the customization of various products as a recent innovation—the fact that there are "more opportunities" now indicates that there were opportunities before—and no other innovations, in product manufacturing or otherwise, are discussed. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss any particular company or example and instead speaks broadly about the trend of companies providing customizable products. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses companies offering something that consumers like and are willing to pay more for—the ability to customize products—it doesn’t characterize this as a product-marketing technique and doesn’t compare it to any other kind of offering or technique.</p>

          <p><strong>Text 1</strong></p>
<p>Italian painters in the 1500s rarely depicted themselves in their work. Even more rare were self-portrait paintings that portrayed the artist as a painter. At the time, painting was not yet respected as a profession, so painters mostly chose to emphasize other qualities in their self-portraits, like their intellect or social status. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the city of Bologna, the first artist to depict themself painting was a man named Annibale Carracci.</span> A painting of his from around 1585 shows Carracci in front of an easel holding a palette. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>
<p>In their self-portraits, Bolognese artists typically avoided referring to the act of painting until the mid-1600s. However, Lavinia Fontana’s 1577 painting, <em>Self-Portrait at the Keyboard</em>, stands out as the earliest example of such a work by an artist from Bologna. Although the artist is depicted playing music, in the background, one can spot a painting easel by a window.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 states that Fontana’s painting, which depicts a painting easel in the background, was made in 1577, eight years before Carracci’s painting. Therefore, they might argue that Caracci was not “the first artist” to depict themself as a painter. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The texts don’t support this choice. Neither text mentions the reputation or status of either Carracci or Fontana. Choice B is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not comment on the intention or meaning of Fontana’s self-depiction in <em>Self-Portrait at the Keyboard</em>. This choice also holds little connection to the underlined claim. Choice C is incorrect. The texts don’t support this choice. The author of Text 2 does not suggest any inspirational relationship between Fontana and Carracci. The author of Text 2 is concerned with showing that Fontana’s painting is the earliest example of an artist referring to painting in their self-portrait, but makes no mention of her influence on others. </p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence. The sentence indicates that scientists used time-lapse photography during both day and night to detect pollinators visiting red clover. Therefore, the underlined sentence has the function of describing an approach scientists used in the pollinator study discussed in the text.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence discusses equipment the scientists used to conduct their study, and the text provides nothing to suggest these elements of their experimental design could, by themselves, question claims resulting from the study. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined sentence or the rest of the text addresses whether moths have a preference for red clover or any other flowers. Choice D is incorrect. Although the sentences that follow the underlined sentence discuss research findings, nothing in the text suggests that these findings were unexpected. Moreover, the underlined sentence describes part of the scientists’ experimental design (day and night time-lapse photography), not a finding of the scientists’ study.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of letters allegedly exchanged between President Lincoln and Rutledge. In this context, “validate” means to confirm that something is real or correct. According to the text, it was alleged, or claimed, that the newly discovered letters had been written by Lincoln and Rutledge. The text also indicates that historians ultimately decided the letters were a hoax, or fraudulent. This context suggests that the historians couldn’t confirm that the letters were authentic. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text focuses on the authenticity of the letters, which were claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge and were then quickly dismissed as fraudulent by historians. Rather than conveying that the historians simply weren’t able to “interpret,” or explain in an understandable way, the letters’ authenticity, the text suggests that the historians decided the letters lacked authenticity altogether. Choice C is incorrect. The text states that the historians quickly dismissed the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge as fraudulent; this suggests that rather than being unable to “relate,” or tell others about, the letters’ authenticity, the historians were able to share what they’d decided about the letters. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the historians couldn’t “accommodate,” or give consideration to, the authenticity of the letters claimed to have been written by Lincoln and Rutledge; the text states that the historians decided that the letters were fraudulent, which indicates that they <em>did </em>consider whether the letters were authentic. </p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The previous sentence broadly mentions "autobiographies written by the freedom seekers." This sentence identifies Loguen’s autobiography as a specific example.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The sentence never explains why Loguen chose to write about his experiences. Choice C is incorrect. The previous sentence identifies autobiographies as useful sources of historical information about a specific topic, but not for "information about geography." The underlined sentence provides details of one autobiography as an example of a source of information about that specific topic (interactions between Indigenous people and Black freedom seekers). Choice D is incorrect. The text never discusses other specific people who helped freedom seekers, and therefore can’t make a comparison between the Neshnabé and anyone else.</p>

          <p>Why do sand cats purr but lions roar? Researchers hypothesize that this difference between the two feline species may be partly due to a U-shaped bone in their throats called the hyoid. Sand cats, which are much smaller than lions, have a rigid hyoid that rumbles when the cat’s larynx vibrates, resulting in a purr. By contrast, lions have a somewhat flexible hyoid, and the bone is attached to the skull with a stretchy ligament that sand cats lack. These traits allow lions and most other species of big cats to produce powerful roars. The same traits may also prevent most big cats from purring.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by posing a question about two different cat species: "Why do sand cats purr but lions roar?" The remainder of the text then presents a possible answer to this question by explaining a hypothesis about differences in these cats’ hyoid bone structure.

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss the habitats of sand cats and lions at all, nor does it mention any changes to their habitats. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe a behavior shared by the two cat species mentioned. On the contrary, it specifically focuses on the different vocalization behaviors of each species (purring versus roaring) and why those differences may exist.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how a data-transfer project affected data from equipment from the Apollo Moon landings. In this context, "available" means accessible or able to be used. The text explains that the Apollo equipment is still on the Moon, but the data it collected "were mostly inaccessible" until a data-transfer project was undertaken. The text then states that this project allowed a researcher to use the information that has been collected. This context makes it clear that the project made previously inaccessible data available, or accessible.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because saying that a project made data from the Apollo equipment on the Moon "predictable" would mean that the data could be known or declared in advance, and it’s not clear how that would be achieved, particularly with data that had been "mostly inaccessible" before the project. Rather than suggesting that the data-transfer project made the data predictable, the text conveys that it made the data available to be used as sources of information. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence indicates that data from the Apollo equipment on the Moon were "mostly inaccessible" until a recent data-transfer project did something to them, after which a researcher was able to make use of the data. This context conveys that the project made the data accessible and usable, not that it made them "complicated," or complex or difficult to understand. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "representative" would mean either standing as a symbol of something or serving as a typical example from a group, and the text gives no indication that data retrieved from the Apollo equipment on the Moon was merely an example or symbolic. Rather, the text focuses on the availability and usefulness of the data, indicating that a data-transfer project enabled a researcher to use data that had previously been "mostly inaccessible."</p>

The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes “the loss of material quality.” The text contrasts that with Chazovachii’s chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text’s emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context “resilient” would mean able to withstand difficulty and the text does not characterize the plastic-recycling process as having this quality or describe any difficulties that these processes might need to overcome. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “dynamic” would mean constantly changing. Although the text suggests that there have been changes in the field of recycling, as is the case with the advent of Chazovachii’s chemical recycling process, there is nothing to suggest that the mechanical process itself has changed or is prone to change. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “satisfactory” would mean acceptable but not perfect. The text mentions only shortcomings of the mechanical process (environmental effects and lower material quality), so the text more strongly supports a negative view of this process and provides no evidence that it would be considered satisfactory. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how predators feed their young. As used in this context, "provide" means supply or make something that’s needed available. The text indicates that some predators supply prey for their young by either leaving dead prey nearby or by bringing live prey to them. Other predators, the text states, feed their young directly from their own mouths. This context supports the idea that predatory animals have various ways to provide food for their young.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "avoid" would mean keep away from or refrain from, neither of which would make sense in context. Nothing in the text suggests that predators refrain from food for their young. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "guess" would mean speculate or suppose, and it’s unclear what it would mean for predators to speculate food for their young. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "describe" would mean explain, and it’s unclear what it would mean for predators to explain food for their young.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the flashes created by fireflies. In this context, “patterns” means distinct and predictable sequences. The text indicates that although the flashes that fireflies produce appear to occur randomly—that is, without any particular sequence or rhythm—each species actually produces its own special series of flashes and pauses. Indeed, these series of flashes are so unique that fireflies can use them to find other members of their species. Therefore, this context supports the idea that fireflies produce flashes in distinct and recognizable patterns. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “quantities” means certain amounts or numbers of something. Although the text discusses how different firefly species produce flashes and pauses in unique sequences that help other members of their species to find them, it doesn’t mention the number of flashes that are used in these sequences. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “decorations” would mean things that make an object more beautiful. Although it may be reasonable to say that firefly flashes are beautiful, the text focuses on the fact that fireflies use these unique sequences of flashes to find other members of their own species, not that the flashes make fireflies more beautiful. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “agreements” would refer to deals that individuals have discussed and come to a consensus about. Since fireflies aren’t capable of making such agreements, it wouldn’t make sense to use this word to refer to the signals they send each other with their flashes. </p>

<p>Astronomer Mark Holland and colleagues examined four white dwarfs—small, dense remnants of past stars—in order to determine the composition of exoplanets that used to orbit those stars. Studying wavelengths of light in the white dwarf atmospheres, the team reported that traces of elements such as lithium and sodium support the presence of exoplanets with continental crusts similar to Earth’s.</p>

<p>Past studies of white dwarf atmospheres have concluded that certain exoplanets had continental crusts. Geologist Keith Putirka and astronomer Siyi Xu argue that those studies unduly emphasize atmospheric traces of lithium and other individual elements as signifiers of the types of rock found on Earth. The studies don’t adequately account for different minerals made up of various ratios of those elements, and the possibility of rock types not found on Earth that contain those minerals.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it reflects how Putirka and Xu (Text 2) would likely characterize the conclusion presented in Text 1. Text 1 discusses a study by Mark Holland and colleagues in which they detected traces of lithium and sodium in the atmospheres of four white dwarf stars. The team claims that this supports the idea that exoplanets with continental crusts like Earth’s once orbited these stars. Text 2 introduces Putirka and Xu, who indicate that sodium and lithium are present in several different minerals and that some of those minerals might exist in types of rock that are not found on Earth. Therefore, Putirka and Xu would likely describe the conclusion in Text 1 as questionable because it does not consider that lithium and sodium are also found in rocks that are not like Earth’s continental crust. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the texts do not indicate how widely held any of the viewpoints described are. Choice B is incorrect because neither text discusses how new this area of study is. Choice D is incorrect because neither text discusses how likely lithium and sodium are to be detected by analyzing wavelengths of light. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Indigenous method of harvesting <em>Hierochloe odorata.</em> As used in this context, “replenishes” means helps increase the population or helps it recover. The text explains that although snapping off a wild plant at the root might seem detrimental to the wild population, it actually helps <em>Hierochloe odorata</em>, increasing both their “number and vigor.” This context conveys the idea that even though it seems counterintuitive, the Indigenous method of harvesting <em>Hierochloe odorata</em> actually replenishes the wild population. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although a harvesting method could be used to select for certain traits in plants, it’s not clear what it would mean for a harvesting method to select “wild populations” of plants. Choice B is incorrect because as used in this context, “originates” means creates. The text doesn’t address the origin of <em>Hierochloe odorata</em>, but rather how the Indigenous harvesting method affects it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, “conditions” means to influence someone or something to behave in a certain way, and the text doesn’t suggest the new plants that replace the harvested ones differ in any meaningful way, or in any way that could be the result of conditioning. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the sounds made by güiros. In this context, “variable” means able to change. The text begins by explaining that güiros are instruments made out of hollowed gourds with ridges cut into their sides and that players scrape the ridges with wooden sticks to produce sounds. The text goes on to say that güiros’ sounds can change depending on gourd thickness, the distance between ridges, and the types of strokes the player uses, thus supporting the idea that the sounds created by these instruments are variable. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “overlooked” means not being seen or noticed, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are overlooked or not noticed. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “powerful” would mean having a great ability to produce an effect. While it’s possible that the sounds produced by güiros have a strong effect on listeners, the text doesn’t discuss this aspect of their sounds. Choice C is incorrect because “routine” means usual and unvarying, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that the sounds produced by güiros are unvarying. In fact, the text describes how the sounds produced by güiros can differ based on several factors. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the challenge of generating electricity from ocean waves. In this context, "consistent" means steady or unchanging over time. The text introduces a challenge and then explains that wave power varies, or changes, unpredictably in ways that cause problems for electricity generation. This context conveys that the challenge being described is a lack of consistency.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text introduces a challenge and then elaborates on it by emphasizing that the unpredictable nature of variations in ocean waves causes problems, which doesn’t indicate that wave power isn’t "accidental," or isn’t happening unintentionally. It wouldn’t make sense to describe waves—a natural occurrence—as happening intentionally. Choice B is incorrect because "confident" means having a feeling of self-assurance, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe wave power itself in terms of either having or lacking a sense of confidence. Choice C is incorrect because the text introduces a challenge and then elaborates on it by emphasizing that the unpredictable nature of variations in ocean waves causes problems, which doesn’t indicate that wave power isn’t "expensive," or isn’t costly. If anything, technological and planning problems might actually increase the expense of generating electricity from waves.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although some studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In other words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying that even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects cognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as a "case in point" (that is, as an example of the point made previously). According to the text, O’Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is more cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making tasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found, however, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same—posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a circumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O’Brien and Ahmed’s study shows why it is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O’Brien and Ahmed’s study to illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture’s effects on cognition.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text discusses O’Brien and Ahmed’s study as an example of why caution is needed when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are often misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture and cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O’Brien and Ahmed’s study is not one of those studies, and there is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O’Brien and Ahmed’s findings. Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the methods used in previous studies of the effects of posture on cognition. Although the text does urge caution when discussing posture’s effects on cognition, it does not critique the results of studies that suggested that posture can affect cognition. Instead, the text suggests that such results should not be exaggerated or taken too broadly. Choice C is incorrect because although the text implies that overstating posture’s effects on cognition would be a problem, nothing in the text suggests that O’Brien and Ahmed share that view or that they attempted to solve that problem. O’Brien and Ahmed are presented as hypothesizing that posture would affect cognition in their study, not as trying to resolve the problem the text describes.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, "clear" most nearly means transparent, or see-through. Muir states that the water beneath the boat "was so clear that it was almost invisible," suggesting that those on the boat were able to see through the water and easily observe plants and fish below the surface.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In some contexts "clear" can mean "simple," or uncomplicated, but Muir is describing the water, and water isn’t typically described as either simple or complicated. Muir emphasizes the water’s transparency, not its simplicity. Choice B is incorrect. In some contexts "clear" can mean "understandable," or reasonable or easily comprehended, but Muir is describing the water, and it doesn’t make much sense to describe water as understandable. Muir emphasizes the water’s transparency, not how easily the water can be understood. Choice C is incorrect. Although "clear" can mean "obvious," or easily seen or understood, in some contexts, Muir’s description emphasizes that the water "was almost invisible" and that the boat seemed to be "sustained in the air," suggesting that the water was almost impossible to see, not that it was obvious.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined statement functions in the text as a whole. The underlined statement mentions a category of animals that have a feature in common: they tend to have fixed geographic ranges throughout their lifetimes. The text then presents the speculation of some researchers that the Arctic woolly mammoth might also share this characteristic. However, an examination of the content of strontium in the strata (or layers) of a woolly mammoth tusk indicated that contrary to the researchers’ hypothesis, the mammoth had an expanding range in its environment that contracted in its last 1.5 years of life. Thus, the underlined statement discusses a characteristic shared by certain animals in order to explain why researchers raised a possibility that turned out not to be supported by data described later in the text.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined statement presents a pattern of behavior (the habit of certain animals of staying within a fixed geographic range), the rest of the text does not present a theory of exceptions to that pattern; rather, the researchers are merely concerned with whether one particular animal has behavior consistent with the pattern. Choice C is incorrect. Though the underlined statement does describe a similarity in the behavior of certain animals (their tendency to stay within a fixed geographic range), this is not done in order to show why a method described later in the text failed to show whether another animal showed that behavior; rather, the method of analysis of strata of a woolly mammoth tusk showed that the mammoth’s behavior was different from that of the animals mentioned in the underlined statement. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined statement mentions a trait shared by a number of animals (their fixed geographic range), the rest of the text does not present a hypothesis regarding the origin of that trait; rather, the researchers are concerned with whether another particular animal shares that trait.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the consequences of raising the age at which retirees begin receiving government funds. The text indicates that raising the age for these funds is usually discussed in terms of effects on fund recipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the effects on working family members who care for retirees. Smythe notes that raising the age for the funds would increase the length of time retirees are dependent on financial assistance from working family members. This is suggested to have an effect on wealth creation for those workers, and most logically, that effect would be disadvantageous. Thus, "stymie," which means to prevent or greatly hinder, is the most logical choice in context.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "compound" would most nearly mean multiply or greatly enhance. The text indicates that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds will increase the amount of time retirees are dependent on working family members for financial support. This would likely have a negative rather than a positive effect on wealth creation. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "disparage" would most nearly mean criticize or defame. Nothing in the text suggests that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds would defame wealth creation among working adults. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "outstrip" would most nearly mean to exceed, and nothing in the text indicates that the financial support provided to retirees would exceed the amount of wealth these workers can create. The text does suggest that workers providing funds to retirees works against those workers’ wealth accumulation, but not that the support to retirees exceeds the workers’ accumulated wealth.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. First, the speaker describes observing a “most beautiful” sight: a tree (“black cypress”) standing out from the golden sky behind it, looking like a person’s finger “pointing upwards” and appearing “sensitive” and “exquisite.” Then the speaker wonders about the image’s meaning, asking why the finger is black and why it’s pointing upward. Thus, the text moves from the speaker’s description of a distinctive sight in nature to her pondering about what meaning to attribute to that sight. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the speaker assesses a natural sight—a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed finger—but doesn’t question the accuracy of her own assessment. Although she wonders why the finger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing, the speaker doesn’t suggest that her belief that the tree resembles a finger is wrong. Choice C is incorrect. Although the speaker describes seeing a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed finger, she wonders about that natural image (asking why the finger, which is really a tree, is black and why it’s pointing) and doesn’t give any indication that any people are present in the scene. Choice D is incorrect. Although the speaker examines and wonders about one thing in her surroundings—a “black cypress” tree standing “against a gold, gold sky” like a pointed finger—she doesn’t address her own emotional state or consider how it’s affected by her surroundings. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ward and colleagues’ findings. As used in this context, “innocuous” means mild or unharmful. The text describes the vibration and warming that Ward and colleagues used to alleviate itching as “harmless applications” and goes on to contrast these applications with another stimulus that actually offers more relief even though it seems to be stronger and “less benign.” This context conveys the idea that vibration and warming were innocuous stimuli. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a distinction between harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. Nothing in the text suggests that any of the treatments are “deceptive,” or misleading; indeed, even the less effective ones are described as offering some relief. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on the amount of relief from itching offered by harmless stimuli and those that seem to be less benign. The text doesn’t suggest that any of these stimuli are “novel,” or original and new; heat, vibration, and electricity aren’t new inventions. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to describe an application of vibration or warming as “impractical,” or not suitable for use. The text indicates that these harmless applications are useful in that they offer at least some temporary relief. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the utility of the Oase 1 fossil to paleoanthropologists. As used in this context, "discern" means to detect or recognize something, especially something hidden or obscure. The text indicates that the Oase 1 fossil can help paleoanthropologists recognize patterns in the evolutionary process and shed light on ("illuminate") the period in which Oase 1 lived. Thus, the fossil will enable researchers to gain insights into, or discern, facts that are still not well understood.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "exploit" would suggest that the paleoanthropologists are using "steps in the evolution of hominids," which does not make logical sense. Rather, the text is about how the Oase 1 fossil could help paleoanthropologists learn about hominid evolution and the Pleistocene epoch more generally. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "prioritize" would suggest that either the paleoanthropologists are placing more importance on "steps in the evolution of hominids" than they are on something else not identified in the text or that they are placing these steps in some sort of order. Rather, the text is about how the Oase 1 fossil could help paleoanthropologists learn about hominid evolution and the Pleistocene epoch more generally. Choice D is incorrect because to say that paleoanthropologists could "yield" or generate "steps in the evolution of hominids" doesn’t make sense. The researchers may develop new insights into those evolutionary steps, but they do not create those steps themselves. Rather, the context makes it clear that they are detecting or discovering patterns based on their study of the Oase 1 fossil.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how Nia Imara facilitates the study of star formations. As used in this context "intangible" means unable to be physically handled or touched. The text states that star formations cannot be touched, and then goes on to explain that Imara created a special model to research star formations. In other words, despite the fact that real star formations are intangible, thanks to Imara, researchers can handle models of star formations to better understand them.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "repeatable" means can be duplicated or done again, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that the swirls of gas and dust in which stars form are untouchable, but that Nia Imara has produced interactive models of them. It would therefore be illogical to suggest that Imara believes that the formations need not be duplicated and then go on to say that she has copied them. Choice B is incorrect because "explicable" means explainable or understandable, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Nia Imara believes that star formations can be fully explained but rather that she produced interactive models to physically study them because researchers are unable to touch them directly. Choice C is incorrect because "regrettable" means distressing or unfortunate, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text does not suggest that Imara believes the researchers regret the star formations or find them distressing, but rather that she uses interactive models to physically study them.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Annie Dodge Wauneka’s work as a Navajo Nation legislator. As used in this context, “persistent” means existing continuously. The text states that Wauneka “continuously worked to promote public health,” traveling extensively and authoring a medical dictionary; this indicates that Wauneka’s effort was persistent. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because describing Wauneka’s effort related to public health as “impartial,” or not partial or biased and treating all things equally, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text suggests that Wauneka’s continuous work was partial in one way, as she focused specifically on promoting public health throughout the Navajo homeland and to speakers of the Navajo language. Choice B is incorrect because the text emphasizes that Wauneka’s effort to promote public health as a Navajo Nation legislator was continuous and extensive, involving wide travels and the authoring of a medical dictionary. Because this work clearly involved care and dedication, it wouldn’t make sense to describe it as “offhand,” or casual and informal. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Wauneka’s effort to promote public health was “mandatory,” or required by law or rule, even though Wauneka was a Navajo Nation legislator. Rather than suggesting that Wauneka’s effort was required for any reason, the text emphasizes the continuous and extensive nature of her work. </p>

<p>The idea that time moves in only one direction is instinctively understood, yet it puzzles physicists. According to the second law of thermodynamics, at a macroscopic level some processes of heat transfer are irreversible due to the production of entropy—after a transfer we cannot rewind time and place molecules back exactly where they were before, just as we cannot unbreak dropped eggs. But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes <em>should</em> be reversible.</p>

<p>In 2015, physicists Tiago Batalhão et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system of carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform. But the experiment “does not pinpoint ... what causes [irreversibility] at the microscopic level,” coauthor Mauro Paternostro said.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can’t solve: at a microscopic level, the “laws of physics” suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe, turn back time!). The experiment confirmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it didn’t explain why. This supports Author 1’s point that physicists still don’t fully understand how things work at a microscopic level—maybe the laws need to be revised. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name two of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect. This is the opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment confirmed that the macroscopic-level law (“these things can’t be reversed—like time”) was still true on the microscopic level—meaning it supports the current understanding of physics at a macroscopic level. Choice D is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Neither text makes this distinction between laboratory findings and the way the universe works in general. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of how Pico feels about the natural world. In this context, to say that Pico portrays his “ambivalence toward” nature would mean that he portrays his mixed feelings about nature. The text explains that Pico “honors the centrality of nature” and also makes it clear that he doesn’t enjoy being in nature. This context suggests that Pico feels ambivalence toward nature. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “responsiveness to” nature would mean that he portrays himself as quick to react to nature, which isn’t supported by the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature’s role in his tribe’s beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “renunciation of” nature would mean that he portrays himself as rejecting nature, which isn’t supported by the text. The text conveys that Pico demonstrates both positive and negative responses toward nature, not that he’s giving it up completely. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his “mastery over” nature would mean that he portrays himself as having control over nature, which isn’t supported by the text. The text focuses on Pico’s mixed feelings about nature; nothing in the text suggests that Pico feels mastery over nature. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fossil deposit. In this context, "obtain" means gain or acquire. According to the text, a team of paleontologists has found fossils that are very well preserved. For this reason, the text suggests, the paleontologists have been able to gain detailed information from the fossils, such as the color patterns of the life forms that left them behind.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "occupy" means engage or inhabit, neither of which would make sense in context. It’s unclear what it would mean for detailed information revealed by fossils to be engaged or inhabited. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the paleontologists wanted to "hoard," or collect and hide, the detailed information revealed by the well-preserved fossils. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the paleontologists wanted to "reserve," or withhold, the detailed information revealed by the well-preserved fossils.</p>

<p>Graphic novels are increasingly popular in bookstores and libraries, but they shouldn’t be classified as literature. By definition, literature tells a story or conveys meaning through language only; graphic novels tell stories through illustrations and use language only sparingly, in captions and dialogue. Graphic novels are experienced as series of images and not as language, making them more similar to film than to literature.</p>

<p>Graphic novels present their stories through both language and images. Without captions and dialogue, readers would be unable to understand what is depicted in the illustrations: the story results from the interaction of text and image.

Therefore, graphic novels qualify as literary texts.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn’t be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used "only sparingly"—that is, comparatively very little—in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn’t be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are "beautifully written" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel’s storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn’t be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there’s no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn’t fit the particular definition of "literature" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are "beautifully written," and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn’t imply that graphic novels aren’t well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of "literature," and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written—that is, well crafted—as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren’t well crafted.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The underlined sentence establishes a difference between Uncle Katsuhisa and the narrator’s father by describing Uncle Katsuhisa as "loud" and the narrator’s father as "quiet." The text then elaborates on that contrast, describing some ways Uncle Katsuhisa is very noisy even when he isn’t speaking.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate what kinds of topics Uncle Katsuhisa enjoys discussing, only that he is loud even when he isn’t speaking. Choice B is incorrect because the text never indicates how Uncle Katsuhisa feels about meeting new people, only how loud he is. Choice D is incorrect because the text never describes a conversation occurring between any people; it refers to talking only when stating that Uncle Katsuhisa is loud even when he isn’t speaking.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the work of particle physicists. In this context, “inspecting” means viewing closely in order to examine. The text indicates that as particle physicists, Arce and El-Khadra’s work involves using advanced technology to “closely examine” subatomic particles. In other words, they use technology to inspect small parts of matter that can’t be seen by the naked eye. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “selecting,” or choosing, subatomic particles for some purpose; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Arce and El-Khadra spend time “creating” subatomic particles, or bringing them into existence; the text simply states that the particle physicists use advanced technology to see and study the behavior of those tiny parts of matter. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “deciding” would mean making a final choice or judgment about something. It wouldn’t make sense to say that particle physicists get to choose what is and isn’t visible to the naked eye, especially when the text presents it as fact that subatomic particles are “the smallest detectable parts of matter” and would therefore be invisible. The text focuses on Arce and El-Khadra’s close observation of those particles, not on any decisions they might make. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, "disputing" most nearly means providing resistance to. The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as "the multitude of Paris," meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that "every inch" of the taxi’s progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi’s attempt to drive down the street.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "disputing" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn’t portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "disputing" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn’t suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi’s attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi’s progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time. The narrator doesn’t go so far as to suggest that the people feel that they, and not the taxi, possess exclusive access to the street.</p>

<p>What factors influence the abundance of species in a given ecological community? Some theorists have argued that historical diversity is a major driver of how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes: differences in community diversity across otherwise similar habitats, in this view, are strongly affected by the number of species living in those habitats at earlier times. </p>
<p>Text 2</p>
<p>In 2010, a group of researchers including biologist Carla Cáceres created artificial pools in a New York forest. They stocked some pools with a diverse mix of zooplankton species and others with a single zooplankton species and allowed the pool communities to develop naturally thereafter. Over the course of four years, Cáceres and colleagues periodically measured the species diversity of the pools, finding—contrary to their expectations—that by the end of the study there was little to no difference in the pools’ species diversity. </p>
          <p>Based on the texts, how would Cáceres and colleagues (Text 2) most likely describe the view of the theorists presented in Text 1?</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer. This is how Cáceres and co. would most likely describe the view presented in Text 1. The view in Text 1 is that historical diversity affects how diverse an ecological community eventually becomes. But Cáceres and co. did not get this result: they found no difference in eventual diversity between a zooplankton pool that started out diverse and a zooplankton pool that started out with only a single species.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect. Cáceres and co. would probably not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way. Their experiment was designed to test this hypothesis, and their findings were "contrary to their expectations." In other words, before the study, they predicted the theory was correct. Choice D is incorrect. Cáceres and co. would not describe the view presented in Text 1 this way.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the discovery of a carved wooden figure dating to around 2,000 years ago. In this context, “rarely” means infrequently. The text states that the discovery of the figure was “truly surprising” and notes that wooden objects are highly prone to rot. This context conveys the idea that wooden objects infrequently survive for as long as the carved figure has survived. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “sturdily” means strongly, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If wooden objects in general could strongly survive for long periods of time, then the discovery of a wooden figure that’s around 2,000 years old wouldn’t be surprising. Choice B is incorrect because “carelessly” means accidentally. The text conveys the idea that wooden objects in general don’t survive for very long because they rot, not that wooden objects in general accidentally survive despite this. Choice D is incorrect because the text conveys the idea that wooden objects in general don’t survive for very long because they rot, not that wooden objects in general “simply,” or merely, survive for long periods of time. If wooden objects in general could merely survive for as long as the figure has survived, then the discovery of the figure wouldn’t have been surprising. </p>

<p>Mycoprotein is a fungal biomass that can be eaten as an alternative to meat. Studies of the environmental impact of its manufacture generally agree it is lower than that of beef and closer to that of chicken or pork. But the expense of producing mycoprotein restricts its availability to a few countries with postindustrial economies. Knowing that cost reductions would expand access to mycoprotein, biochemists are exploring solutions, such as a cheaper substrate to feed the mycoprotein as it grows.</p>

<p>Cattle farming is a principal cause of global deforestation, and a study by Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues found that replacing 20% of beef consumption worldwide with consumption of mycoprotein would cut deforestation by half if accomplished over the next thirty years. However, this would likely involve only a small change in agricultural water consumption, since water once dedicated to raising cattle would be diverted to raising crops instead.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to the study findings described in Text 2. The author of Text 2 discusses a study by Florian Humpenöder and his colleagues that found that deforestation would be reduced by half over the next thirty years if 20% of the beef consumed worldwide were replaced with mycoprotein. The author of Text 1 points out that mycoprotein is not widely available because of its high production cost, but goes on to note that this problem could be addressed by the creation of a cheaper substrate to feed mycoprotein. This suggests that the author of Text 1 would assert that the development of a less expensive mycoprotein substrate would contribute to the reduction in deforestation described in the study findings discussed in Text 2: if reducing the cost of mycoprotein increases people’s access to it, then mycoprotein may be able to replace beef in more people’s diets, thereby reducing the deforestation associated with beef production.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 1 indicates that the environmental impact of mycoprotein production is close to that of chicken or pork production, so there is no reason to think that the author would assert that replacing chicken or pork with mycoprotein would be environmentally beneficial: such a replacement would not lessen the total environmental impact of food manufacture. Additionally, the specific issue of agricultural water consumption is never mentioned in Text 1, so there is no evidence indicating what the author of Text 1 would say about that issue. Choice C is incorrect. Although Text 1 does compare the environmental effects of producing mycoprotein to those of producing chicken or pork, nothing in Text 1 suggests that the author believes that people are more likely to replace chicken or pork with mycoprotein than they are to replace beef with mycoprotein. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 makes no mention of countries’ varying contributions to deforestation, so there is no evidence that the author of Text 1 would respond to the finding described in Text 2 by saying that some countries will have to replace more than 20% of their beef consumption with mycoprotein.</p>

In the text, Mrs. Higgins complains that Henry offends all her friends and that they stop coming when he’s also visiting. She then tells him directly, "you mustn’t stay." The overall exchange conveys Mrs. Higgins’s intention for Henry to leave so as not to drive away her friends with his behavior.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate what Henry’s mother does when she’s out with her friends.

Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t contain an account of what Henry’s home looks like. The setting is established as the house of Henry’s mother, and the dialogue focuses solely on her wish that Henry should depart before her friends arrive. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention how often Henry visits his mother nor does it provide any explanation for why he visits his mother.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of John Ashbery’s poems. As used in this context, “interpret” would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Ashbery’s poems have many unusual features, that it’s difficult to tell what exactly the poems’ subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it’s difficult to interpret Ashbery’s poems. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “delegate” means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context. The text is focused only on the difficulty that readers have interpreting Ashbery’s poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn’t suggest anything about the poems being difficult to delegate. Choice B is incorrect because describing Ashbery’s poems as difficult to “compose,” or put together or produce, would make sense only if the text were about Ashbery’s experience of writing the poems. It could be true that it was difficult for Ashbery to compose his poems, but the text doesn’t address this; it instead discusses how readers interpret and engage with the poems. Choice D is incorrect because describing Ashbery’s poems as being difficult to “renounce,” or give up or refuse, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that features of Ashbery’s poems are odd or unclear and have caused heated scholarly debate. This context suggests that the poems are difficult to interpret, not that the poems are difficult to renounce. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. "Protect" means "preserve" or "keep safe from." By ensuring that the wilderness areas along the Appalachian Trail can’t be sold or developed, the National Trails System Act protects them.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. "Borrow" means "to take something with intent to return it." The text doesn’t say anything about taking and returning the wilderness that surrounds the Appalachian Trail. Choice B is incorrect. "Postpone" means "to put off until later." Nothing in the passage suggests that Congress wants to "postpone" the wilderness areas (and that doesn’t make sense anyway—they can postpone doing something to the wilderness areas, but they can’t postpone the areas themselves). Choice D is incorrect. "Decorate" means "to adorn" or "add extra items or pictures to make more attractive." No details in the text suggest that Congress wishes to make the trail fancier or more attractive.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be “keenly sensitive to” scenes that serve as a “fitting background” for her feelings—that is, she’s very aware of when a setting seems to reflect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she’s in as a large-scale reflection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It’s the next sentence that adds specific details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conflict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reflects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reflect her current mood, and that assertion isn’t expanded on in the next sentence. Instead, the next sentence describes specific details of the scene without connecting them to Lily’s feelings. </p>

<p>Flamingos are known for their vibrant pink coloring, but they’re actually born with gray feathers. Their pink color comes from eating brine shrimp, but brine shrimp aren’t naturally pink either. Animals can’t produce carotenoids, the pigments that provide the pink hue. The algae that brine shrimp feed on, however, can produce these pigments. Thus, the pinker the flamingo, the more shrimp it has eaten.</p>

<p>Ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos apply a kind of makeup to make themselves appear pinker. A gland near their tail contains pigments that come from the food they eat. When the flamingos groom themselves using the pigments, their feathers become pinker. Flamingos may do this to improve their success during mating season, when they would benefit from looking pinker.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it describes how the ecologist in Text 2 would most likely respond to the author’s conclusion in Text 1 based on the information provided. The author of Text 1 states that the pink color of flamingo feathers comes from pigments carried by the brine shrimp flamingos consume. The author of Text 1 concludes that this means that a flamingo that is pinker than another flamingo must have eaten more shrimp. However, according to Text 2, ecologist Juan Amat has found that flamingos can also affect how pink they look through grooming, when they move ingested pigments from a gland near the tail to their feathers. This indicates that not all the pigments available from the shrimp a flamingo has eaten automatically end up coloring the flamingo’s feathers; some may or may not be applied later. Since grooming is also a factor, the ecologist (Amat) in Text 2 would most likely respond to the conclusion in Text 1 that pinker flamingos have eaten more shrimp by pointing out that the amount of shrimp eaten isn’t the only thing that influences flamingos’ coloring.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 states that the ecologist has found that flamingos can move pigments to their feathers from a gland near their tail, there is no indication that their tail feathers are pinker than their other feathers. Moreover, the point that tail feathers are pinker than other feathers wouldn’t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo’s coloring. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos’ feathers do sometimes look pinker and gives no indication that this change in color is particularly subtle. Moreover, the point that most observers wouldn’t notice a change wouldn’t logically address the idea that the quantity of shrimp eaten is what determines a flamingo’s coloring. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the ecologist would argue about flamingos’ shrimp consumption. Although Text 2 indicates that the ecologist has found that flamingos may make themselves look pinker during mating season, this is addressed in terms of grooming habits; apart from referring to food as a source of pigments, Text 2 doesn’t discuss the diet of flamingos at all.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish that birds of some species don’t raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specifically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out finding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specific behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence’s general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn’t describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds’ nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it’s the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds’ reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they’ve hatched. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues’ hypothesis regarding this question—which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer—and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team’s hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team’s hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn’t fully understood by scientists and explains a research team’s hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn’t describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn’t mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo’s team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo’s team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of architectural influences among Mesoamerican cities. In this context, “commonalities with” means similarities to or shared attributes with. The text indicates that a recently discovered citadel in Tikal includes a close imitation of a famous temple in Teotihuacán (another Mesoamerican city) and other evidence of Teotihuacán influence, which suggests that the citadel possesses features that resemble architectural features found in Teotihuacán. This context thus indicates that the Tikal citadel shows commonalities with Teotihuacán architecture. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the Tikal citadel shows “refinements of,” or improvements on, Teotihuacán architecture. Although the text suggests that the architecture of Teotihuacán influenced the architecture of the Tikal citadel, and although it’s possible that later architectural designs could make improvements on earlier designs, the text doesn’t discuss whether, in imitating Teotihuacán architecture, the Tikal citadel’s builders improved on it. Choice B is incorrect because describing the citadel in Tikal as showing “precursors of” Teotihuacán architecture—or features that preceded and foreshadowed those of Teotihuacán architecture—would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about the relationship between the architecture found in Tikal and Teotihuacán. The text claims that the discovery of similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuacán, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuacán, provides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuacán architecture, then the Teotihuacán architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuacán architecture. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuacán architecture, which implies that the makers of the Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuacán architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there’s no reason to think that the Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people’s “animosities toward,” or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward, Teotihuacán architecture. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "sheltering" most nearly means protective. In the text, the speaker describes a painting featuring a female figure. The speaker ultimately confesses to falling in love with the woman in the painting, who has "stole[n] away" the speaker’s heart, but first the speaker describes elements of the painting’s setting. These include sterile soil, barren fields with "no ray / Of hope in a blade of green"—a description that conveys a mood of melancholy and forlornness, possibly reflecting the speaker’s own sadness at falling in love with an image that can’t return the speaker’s love. The text continues by stating that there’s no "sheltering roof" in the painting, even though the "skies are heavy and gray," showing signs of an impending storm. Generally, a roof’s intended purpose is to provide protection from the elements, and in this context, a roof would offer shelter and protection from the gathering storm.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that a roof would be restrictive—that is, that it would limit or restrain something in some way. Although a roof would provide some cover from stormy winds and rain, it wouldn’t limit the wind and rain, only deflect them. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that if a "sheltering roof" were present in the painting, it would be affectionate, or loving and tender. In the text, the immediate context in which the word "sheltering" appears refers to the absence of a roof that would provide protection from the oncoming storm depicted in the painting, not to the idea that such a shelter would be loving and tender if it were present. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, suspicious would mean questionable or dubious, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that if any roofs were present in the painting, they would be questionable or cause any suspicion.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “receiving” most nearly means hearing, or perceiving sound. The text describes Mr. Spring Fragrance as he reads a newspaper, focusing on his eyes and ears. While his eyes look at the newspaper, he is unwillingly distracted by words coming through a nearby open window (that is, “his ears could not help receiving the words”). The words are being perceived specifically by his ears and not his eyes, and ears are the organs of sense with which one hears, so therefore Mr. Spring Fragrance is hearing the words through the open window. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that Mr. Spring Fragrance is denying, or refusing the truth of, the words coming to him through the window. He is merely distracted by them. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that Mr. Spring Fragrance’s ears couldn’t help entering, or coming into, the words coming to him through the window. Instead, the text indicates that the opposite occurs: that is, when Mr. Spring Fragrance hears the words, they enter his ears, but his ears don’t enter the words. Choice C is incorrect because it doesn’t make sense in this context to think of Mr. Spring Fragrance as carrying the words coming to him through the window, even though the word “carry” can have a number of different meanings depending on context: for example, he is not lifting them, he is not supporting them, and he is not accepting blame for them (as one “carries the blame” for a mistake). </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of climate activity in Earth’s distant past. In this context, to “simulate” most nearly means to represent a natural process using computer models. According to the text, understanding Earth’s early climate is difficult because we cannot make direct observations of the distant past. Instead, scientists must create computer models that approximate early climate conditions, based on the physical evidence that those conditions left behind on Earth’s surface. This context supports the idea that computer models simulate Earth’s climate in the distant past. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because scientists use existing physical evidence as a basis for developing computer models that describe what Earth’s actual past climate might have been like. The models are not being used to “invent,” or imagine, a completely fictional climate. Choice C is incorrect because the computer models are being used in an attempt to describe as accurately as possible what Earth’s past climate might have been like. They are not attempting to “exaggerate,” or distort, those features. Choice D is incorrect because the computer models do not “preserve,” or protect from deterioration, Earth’s early climate; instead, they attempt to reproduce the characteristics of that climate, based on the remaining physical evidence of that climate. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text states that the CEP had a positive impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. The next sentence explains that the CEP organized workshops for attendees, who later used the knowledge they gained to lead civil rights initiatives. And the underlined portion indicates the number of activists—more than 7,000—who participated in the workshops. Thus, the underlined portion provides a number that underscores the extent of the CEP’s impact on the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence that contains the underlined portion mentions some CEP workshop topics, the underlined portion itself addresses the number of participants in the CEP workshops, not the number of topics covered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to attendees of the CEP workshops, nothing in the underlined portion or the text as a whole addresses the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s philosophy or the attendees’ opinions thereof. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole mentions any criticism of the CEP by members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "supported" most nearly means held up or sustained physically. The sentence describes the physical structure of the Panhandle bridge, stating it was "supported by massive sandstone pillars." This clearly refers to the structural relationship between the bridge and its pillars—the pillars physically hold up the bridge and keep it standing. The text further emphasizes the physical nature of this support by describing the pillars as "stalwart" (strong and sturdy) and noting they’ve been performing this function for fifty years.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts "supported" can mean "encouraged," the sandstone pillars and bridge described in the text are all inanimate objects that can’t provide or receive encouragement. The text clearly describes a structural relationship between the elements of the bridge, not an emotional one. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts "supported" has a meaning similar to "improved on," the text doesn’t suggest that the sandstone pillars have enhanced or made the bridge better; rather, they simply provide the necessary physical foundation to keep the bridge standing. Thus, the sentence describes the structural elements of the bridge, not improvements made to it. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts "supported" can mean "defended," the text doesn’t present a situation in which the sandstone pillars are defending the bridge from a threat. Instead, the description focuses on the physical structure of the bridge, in which the pillars hold the bridge up and ensure its stability.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it characterizes how Maddux would most likely respond to the conclusion Sharif reached after her research. Text 1 describes Sharif’s study of the benefits of free time, saying that the reported sense of satisfaction plateaued at two hours per day and began to decline at five hours per day. Further research led Sharif to conclude that time spent doing tasks she defines as unproductive, such as watching TV or playing games, correlated with a drop in life satisfaction.  However, in Text 2 Maddux says that there is no objective definition of what constitutes productive behavior, giving the example that reading a book might be considered productive by some but unproductive by others. It can be inferred that Maddux would also assert that whether watching TV or playing games is productive or unproductive is a matter of subjective judgment. Thus, Maddux would most likely caution against making an overly broad assumption, as there is no clear consensus in distinguishing between productive and unproductive activities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Maddux asserts that individuals have unique needs for life satisfaction: some may want to spend that time productively, others unproductively, and what counts as productive is subjective. Therefore, Maddux would likely not consider it universally true that free time is more likely to enhance life satisfaction when it is spent productively. Choice B is incorrect because the study described in Text 1 concerns whether free time contributes to life satisfaction, not whether productivity contributes to life satisfaction. The dip in life satisfaction that Sharif claims to observe in Text 1 happens only after five hours, and mainly if the time is spent unproductively—that is, two hours of free time spent productively might increase life satisfaction just as much as two hours spent unproductively. Choice D is incorrect because Maddux holds the opinion that whether an activity is productive or unproductive is subjective and depends on the individual; therefore, he would most likely claim that watching TV or playing games might be productive for some and unproductive for others. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of the Southern Pacific Railroad. As used in this context, "dominance" means the state of being more successful than others. The text states that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways in 1877, and that the Sunset Route it constructed in 1883 was the first transcontinental rail line across the southern United States. Therefore, the Southern Pacific Railroad would be more successful than other railroads in the area, and the construction of the Sunset Route would further solidify its dominance in rail access to California’s coast.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the construction of the Sunset Route must have required some creativity, or use of imagination, the word "creativity" would not also encompass the fact that the Southern Pacific Railroad already controlled 85% of California’s railways. The text is more focused on the railroad’s control of the field and overall success rather than its imaginative thought processes. Choice C is incorrect because if the Southern Pacific Railroad controlled the majority of California’s railways, it would not make sense to refer to its "insignificance," or the state of being unimportant. Rather, the opposite would be true. Choice D is incorrect because in context it would not make sense to refer to the Southern Pacific Railroad’s "neutrality," or absence of strong opinion on a matter, since no opinions are mentioned. Nor would "neutrality" in the sense of impartiality in a conflict be a logical or precise choice since no conflict is explicitly described. There might be an implied conflict between the Southern Pacific Railroad and other railroads doing business in California, but that is not a conflict in which the Southern Pacific Railroad would take an impartial position.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "consider" most nearly means to take into account and follow. The text explains that Marija’s job was to make sure that her sister’s wedding proceeded in certain ways ("in due form") and that she loudly directed everyone’s actions all day. The text then indicates that Marija was so focused on ensuring that others "conformed to the proprieties"—that is, that they behaved in appropriate ways—that she failed to "consider them herself"; that is, she didn’t take standards of appropriate behavior into account and follow them in her own actions.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. In some contexts, "consider" can mean to think about something in a positive way—which can involve admiration—but the text doesn’t suggest that Marija was so busy imposing "proprieties" (standards of appropriate behavior) on others that she didn’t admire and praise them herself. The context suggests it’s more likely that Marija did speak positively of "due form" and "the best home traditions" while ensuring others behaved in certain ways. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, "consider" can mean to come to a decision, but the text doesn’t suggest that Marija wasn’t able to make a decision for herself about the "proprieties" (standards of appropriate behavior) she ensured everyone else conformed to. Rather, the context conveys that Marija knew very clearly which behaviors others should follow as "due form" and "the best home traditions." Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, "consider" can mean to have an opinion, but the text doesn’t suggest that Marija wasn’t able to have an opinion on the "proprieties" (standards of appropriate behavior) she was ensuring others conformed to. Rather, the context conveys that Marija had strong feelings about which behaviors were "due form" and "the best home traditions."</p>

          <p>Mathematician Claude Shannon is widely regarded as a foundational figure in information theory. His most important paper, “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” published in 1948 when he was employed at Bell Labs, utilized a concept called a “binary digit” (shortened to “bit”) to measure the amount of information in any signal and determine the fastest rate at which information could be transmitted while still being reliably decipherable.

<p>Today the starchy root cassava is found in many dishes across West Africa, but its rise to popularity was slow. Portuguese traders brought cassava from Brazil to the West African coast in the 1500s. But at this time, people living in the capitals further inland had little contact with coastal communities. Thus, cassava remained relatively unknown to most of the region’s inhabitants until the 1800s.</p>

<p><span aria-level="2" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Cassava’s slow adoption into the diet of West Africans is mainly due to the nature of the crop itself. If not cooked properly, cassava can be toxic. Knowledge of how to properly prepare cassava needed to spread before the food could grow in popularity. The arrival of formerly enslaved people from Brazil in the 1800s, who brought their knowledge of cassava and its preparation with them, thus directly fueled the spread of this crop.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. Text 1 states that cassava’s “rise to popularity was slow” in West Africa. Text 2 also describes cassava’s “slow adoption into the diet of West Africans.” While the two texts identify different causes for this slow adoption, both agree that cassava took a long time to catch on. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t something that either text claims. Cassava is the only crop discussed in the passages, so we have no basis to draw conclusions about what the authors might say about “several” crops. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t something that either text claims. Neither text mentions the “climate of the West African coast,” so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t something that either text claims. The 1500s were when cassava was brought to West Africa, but neither text describes how cassava is cooked, nor do they make any claims about when cooking methods were developed. </p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence describes a unique location on Earth, the Atacama Desert. The next sentence, which is the underlined sentence, states that the reason why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this unique location is that Atacama is a harsh environment that closely resembles the extreme environment of Mars. The remainder of the text explains that the researchers hope their work in Atacama will support inquiry into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined portion functions mainly to indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because to contrast two things means to show the differences between them, and the phrase "closely mirrors" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extreme environment in the Atacama Desert is similar to, not different from, that on Mars. This similarity is why, according to the underlined sentence, astrobiologists conduct research in Atacama. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t address forms of life that are unable to survive the harsh environment of the Atacama Desert. Instead, the underlined sentence explains why astrobiologists study life, or its remains, in this environment. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t suggest that the scientific research in the Atacama Desert is limited in any way; instead, the sentence explains that the similarity between the environments of Atacama and Mars is the reason why astrobiologists search for life, or its remains, in Atacama.</p>

The text describes the relationship between the main character and those who exhibit, praise, and purchase his artwork. The text states that the main character is often asked to change his art or himself based on outside influences, and he usually acquiesces. Because the main character admits that those who support his work often shape it based on their demands, it follows that those outside influences dictate, or guide or dominate, the direction his work takes.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that outside influences "conclude," or end, the main character’s work. The text states that many supporters of the main character’s art "demand its proliferation," not its conclusion. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that outside influences are "evaluating," or judging the main character’s work. According to the text, the main character’s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character’s work and are not questioning or evaluating its success or worth. They are instead influencing its initial direction. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that outside influences "select," or choose the main character’s work. According to the text, the main character’s art has already achieved great commercial success, with many people exhibiting, purchasing, and praising his work. Thus, outsiders have already supported the main character’s work and are not selecting it. They are instead influencing its initial direction.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the research that Lopes-Ferreira and her colleagues are conducting on the stingray species <em>Potamotrygon rex.</em> As used in this context, “a substantial” effect means an effect that is sizable or noteworthy. The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are “considerable variations” in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays’ age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to find out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text that suggests that the researchers have been studying whether the stingrays’ age and sex have “a disconcerting,” or an unsettling and disturbing, effect on the stingrays’ venom. The text indicates that the researchers wish to determine if stingray age and sex cause large variations in the toxicity of stingray venom, not if the effect of age and sex is disconcerting. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that researchers want to find out whether differences in stingray age and sex produce differences in stingray venom, not that the researchers want to find out whether age and sex have “an acceptable,” or a satisfactory, effect on venom. The text makes no mention of what would make an effect on venom toxicity acceptable and gives no indication that the researchers are interested in that question. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for the researchers to be looking for “an imperceptible,” or an unnoticeable, effect of age and sex on stingray venom. The text says that the researchers are trying to determine if there are “considerable variations” in venom toxicity linked to age and sex, not that the researchers are trying to find effects that they can’t perceive. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined phrase functions in the text as a whole. The text states that the wax produced by Liu and colleagues’ reactor can be turned into a surfactant. The underlined phrase, which is set off with parentheses, then provides a definition for the term "surfactant," explaining that it’s a chemical compound that can be used as a detergent. Thus, the underlined portion of the text functions to clarify the meaning of a scientific term.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Though the text as a whole focuses broadly on an environmental concern, the underlined phrase does not; it simply indicates what a surfactant is. Choice C is incorrect. Though the text as a whole focuses on a scientific discovery (Liu and colleagues’ solution to the problem of plastic recycling), the underlined phrase does not explain its significance; it simply defines a scientific term used in the discussion. Choice D is incorrect. Though the text as a whole includes discussion of the result found by Liu and colleagues, the underlined phrase does not discuss it; it simply defines a scientific term used in the discussion. Additionally, at no point in the text is it mentioned that the team was confused.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, "collects" most nearly means gathers or accumulates. In the text, Gogol "collects" (or gathers) rocks and digs in the sand while strolling the beach with his father. Thus, "gathers" is the best answer.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "increases" would mean expands or inflates, which is not something a child could logically do to rocks. Rather, the text indicates that Gogol "collects" or gathers rocks while strolling the beach with his father. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "makes" would suggest that Gogol is creating or manufacturing rocks, which doesn’t make sense. Rather, the text indicates that Gogol "collects" or gathers rocks while strolling the beach with his father. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "ignores" would mean disregards or avoids, but in the text Gogol "collects rocks," which indicates that he’s engaging with the rocks, not ignoring them.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the preservation efforts undertaken by Erika Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana. In this context, "promote" means play a part in the success or growth of something or someone. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes work to preserve culturally important sites. It goes on to say that their decision to create a national trail connecting the sites was motivated by the fact that such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn’t otherwise receive. Thus, such a decision would promote the preservation efforts.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "inspire" means motivate or influence, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text establishes that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that their decision to create a new national trail occurred as a result of a desire to add protections to the sites that they wouldn’t otherwise receive. Thus, creating the trail wouldn’t inspire the efforts to preserve the sites; instead, it would promote the efforts. Choice B is incorrect because "ignore" means overlook, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn’t otherwise receive. Thus, the creation of the trail would promote, not ignore, the preservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect because "reduce" means decrease or restrict, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that Karuzas and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana work to preserve culturally significant sites and that they decided to create a national trail connecting the sites because such a trail would receive protections from the US government that the sites wouldn’t otherwise receive. The decision would therefore promote, not reduce, the preservation efforts.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence presents the implications of Veeraraghavan’s team’s study: sunshine exposure during work hours can cause overly optimistic behavior. The underlined sentence then describes the data the team consulted and how they were used (comparing predictions about earnings to what the companies actually earned), and the final sentence presents what the team found in their examination of the data. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to explain part of the methodology used in the team’s study. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence explains in part how the team conducted their analysis of the effect of sunshine but doesn’t address what the team found; a broad summary is instead given in the other two sentences. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present any specific examples from the team’s comparisons of 29,000 earnings predictions to actual earnings; it simply explains in part how the team conducted their analysis. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply explains in part how the team conducted their analysis; the text never mentions any challenges that the team encountered in their study. </p>

Neither text suggests that the <em>A.</em> <em>africanus</em> fossils have been "corrupted," but only that traditional dating methods are difficult in Sterkfontein because of floods and soil mixing where the fossils were found. Nothing is implied to have compromised the fossils themselves. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 2. Text 2 agrees that stratigraphy and other methods are prone to error in the context of Sterkfontein: there’s a "potential for misdating" when evaluating age based on soil layers and bones.

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of cucurbits. In this context, “ensuring” means guaranteeing, or making sure of, the cucurbits’ survival. The text states that cucurbits faced extinction in the past because their means of seed dispersal disappeared, but the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America began farming cucurbits around that same time, so the crops were no longer threatened. Therefore, the context supports the idea that the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America helped with ensuring the cucurbits’ survival. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context verifying means making sure that something is accurate. In the text, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were ensuring the survival, not the accuracy of, the cucurbits. Choice B is incorrect. Although the cucurbit crops themselves were multiplying, or growing in number, as a result of the work of the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America, it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that the survival of the plants was multiplying. Choice C is incorrect because according to the text, in raising cucurbits as crops, the ancestors of Indigenous peoples in North America were attempting to help the plants grow and survive; they weren’t attempting to comfort, or free the plants from pain. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The text after the semicolon tells us that Hu "identif[ied] broad similarities between two seemingly different phenomena," comparing ants with light particles. Since an analogy seeks similarities between seemingly unrelated phenomena, this fits the context perfectly.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. "A collaboration" refers to "an act of working with others," but what comes after the semicolon doesn’t describe collaboration with other researchers. Instead, it shows a comparison between two different (but ultimately similar) scientific phenomena. Choice B is incorrect. "An accessory" can refer to "something added to increase attractiveness or usefulness." No accessories are described in this text. Choice C is incorrect. "A contradiction" means "a set of ideas or things that are opposed to or inconsistent with each other." The text describes how Hu used the similarity between ant and light particle movement to develop his method, so a word that refers to difference would not make sense here.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of visual balance in photography. In this context, "contingent on" means conditional upon, or determined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers (for example, symmetrical composition tends to emphasize similarity among elements, whereas asymmetry tends to emphasize difference). Thus, there is a strong connection between what a photograph conveys and how its elements are balanced. Therefore, what a photo conveys is contingent on how it is balanced.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "inhibited by" most nearly means hindered or undermined by. The text indicates that different ways of balancing elements in a photograph convey different ideas to viewers, thereby indicating a relationship between image balance and what is conveyed. Although this explanation is consistent with a photographer choosing asymmetrical balance even while intending to convey similarity (associated with symmetrical balance), there is nothing to indicate that messages generally are inhibited by balance. Rather the implication is that balance is a tool photographers can use to craft their messages. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "obligated to" means duty bound toward or answerable to. In context, it would not make sense to assert that a photograph’s message is obligated to how that photograph is balanced. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "reserved for" most nearly means solely available to someone or held aside for some purpose. The text as a whole does not support the claim that a photograph’s message is reserved for how that photograph is balanced.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text establishes that John has a strong imagination and then goes on to describe the St. John River near John’s home in the Florida woods. The underlined sentence depicts John sending twigs sailing down the river while he imagines them reaching “Jacksonville, the sea, the wide world,” where he wishes he could follow. This suggests that John longs to expand his life experiences beyond the Florida woods. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the second and third sentences of the text provide an extended description of the riverbank where John likes to go, whereas the underlined sentence describes what John does at that location. Choice B is incorrect because the first sentence of the text suggests that John’s behavior “was puzzling” to others around him, whereas the underlined sentence concerns the content of John’s imaginings. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence elaborates on John’s imagination but doesn’t mention any other children to whom John could be compared. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The author describes Coketown as having streets that are all very similar and residents who live similarly and do the same work. This repetition of similarities emphasizes how everything in Coketown is alike. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the text mentions that all the residents “do the same work,” it never explains what that work is or why everyone does it. Besides, the idea that they all do the same work is just one of several similarities among the townspeople described in the text. Choice C is incorrect. While the last sentence states that “every day was the same as yesterday and tomorrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next,” it never suggests that people actually “lose track of time.” This is also too narrow to be the main idea, since time is just one of many aspects of Coketown that the text describes as always being the same. Choice D is incorrect. The text never mentions whether life is simple in Coketown, and the town sounds as though it’s probably a pretty dull place to live, rather than a pleasant one. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd. As used in this context, "inconsequential to" means not significant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd’s works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his influence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren’t inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’s time had access to his works, not whether his works were "controversial among," or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd’s era were aware of his works, not that they were "antagonistic toward," or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd’s writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "imitated by" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd’s works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn’t specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn’t support the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd’s works.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the legitimacy of the reigns of French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I. As used in this context, “buttress” means to strengthen or defend. The text indicates that regardless of whether a French monarch’s reign was significant or uneventful, each monarch faced questions about his right to the throne. The text goes on to say that in order to understand the path of a French monarch’s reign, it’s important to understand what contributed to the monarch’s ability to “hold the throne.” This context suggests that French monarchs such as Hugh Capet and Henry I had to buttress, or defend, their right to be monarch. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “disengage,” or withdraw his right to the French throne. The text focuses on an examination of people who reigned as French monarchs, not on people who didn’t choose to rule. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “annotate,” or add notes to or explain, his right to the French throne. Nothing in the text suggests that the monarchs were writing notes about their right to the throne; instead, faced with questions about the legitimacy of their reign, the monarchs defended their right. Choice D is incorrect. Saying that a monarch who is faced with questions about the legitimacy of his reign was able to “reciprocate” his right to the French throne would mean that he either returned his right to the throne or that he responded in kind to the challenge. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text focuses on people who did reign as French monarchs and defended their right to do so. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to describe the family of plants known as the silversword alliance and explain why the plants came to exhibit "an extraordinary range of phenotypes." The text introduces the silversword alliance as a family of plants unique to the Hawaiian Islands, presenting those that mature into vines and those that mature into shrubs and trees as examples of different phenotypes. The text concludes by explaining that these plants are all descendants of "a single ancestral tarweed plant" that arrived 5 million years ago in the Hawaiian Islands, where a "wide variety of habitats" drove the plant’s descendants to adapt and thus differentiate themselves, diversifying into a group of related but distinct species with different physical characteristics.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text explains why the plants within the silversword alliance have varied physical characteristics, the text doesn’t suggest that tarweed is the ancestor of all plants on the Hawaiian Islands. The text states instead that all members of the silversword alliance descend from a single tarweed ancestor. Choice B is incorrect because while <em>Dubautia carrii</em> is mentioned as an example of a species in the silversword alliance, no details about its particular habitat are provided. And although the text indicates that the Hawaiian Islands are home to "a wide variety of habitats," it doesn’t describe the specific habitat where <em>Dubautia carrii</em> is found. The text discusses the silversword alliance as a whole rather than focusing on <em>Dubautia carrii</em> or any one species within this family. Choice D is incorrect. Although the silversword alliance is only found on the Hawaiian Islands and includes "an extraordinary range of phenotypes," the text doesn’t claim that all plants on the Hawaiian Islands are part of the alliance. Furthermore, the text indicates that these plants all "descended from a single ancestral tarweed plant," not that there are multiple possible candidates for that ancestor plant.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of testing hypotheses regarding usage by means of text corpora. In this context, "supposition" refers to an assumption or hypothesis that is not yet proven. The text explains that text corpora can be used for "empirical testing of hypotheses regarding the frequency of typical word usage" and then provides a specific example of using corpus analysis to support a claim about the word "get." The word "supposition" precisely conveys this idea of an assumption or hypothesis about word frequency that can then be tested against empirical data.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that someone has a "recognition" that the word "get" has a high incidence in English. Recognition implies acknowledging something already established as true or valid, but the text indicates that corpus analysis is needed to support the claim about "get," suggesting its high frequency wasn’t already established or previously known. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that someone has a "scheme" that the word "get" has a high incidence in English. A scheme is a plan or systematic arrangement, but the context indicates what’s needed is a preliminary hypothesis that can be tested with corpus data, not a plan related to word frequency. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that someone has a "synopsis" that the word "get" has a high incidence in English. A synopsis is a summary or outline, but the text is discussing an initial hypothesis about word frequency that requires testing, not a condensed statement of existing information.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. “Indicator” means “something that shows or suggests,” which matches Taleb’s argument that an item’s age can suggest how much longer it will last. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The passage tells us that examining an item’s age is the best way to predict how much longer it will last. Therefore, according to Taleb’s theory, an item’s age should add more certainty about how much longer it will last. Choice C is incorrect. A “motivation” is “a reason for doing.” Items don’t have feelings and motivations, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that their age is a motivation for how much longer they will last. Choice D is incorrect. “Criticism” can mean “describing faults or problems” or “an analysis of an artistic work.” Neither of these definitions makes sense here. An item’s age can’t criticize how much longer it will last. </p>

<p>Films and television shows commonly include a long list of credits naming the people involved in a production. Credit sequences may not be exciting, but they generally ensure that everyone’s contributions are duly acknowledged. Because they are highly standardized, film and television credits are also valuable to anyone researching the careers of pioneering cast and crew members who have worked in the mediums.</p>

<p>Video game scholars face a major challenge in the industry’s failure to consistently credit the artists, designers, and other contributors involved in making video games. Without a reliable record of which people worked on which games, questions about the medium’s development can be difficult to answer, and the accomplishments of all but its best-known innovators can be difficult to trace.</p>

        <summary>Show Answer</summary>
          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to Text 2 based on the information provided. Text 2 discusses how the inconsistent use of credits to identify the contributors to video games can pose an obstacle to scholars of the medium, who rely on such credits to answer questions about the medium’s development. Text 1 notes that in film and television, on the other hand, credits are used consistently and are valuable to researchers studying the cast and crew members in these mediums. Since Text 1 asserts how the consistent use of credits benefits scholars of film and television, it can be inferred that this text’s author would respond to the discussion in Text 2 by observing that the kind of problem faced by scholars of video games—the inability to know who contributed to a particular production and how—is, in film and television studies, largely prevented by the widespread practice of credits in these mediums. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 1 discusses a method used by film and television researchers—namely, relying on credits to research the careers of cast and crew members—the author doesn’t explicitly recommend that or any other method. Moreover, Text 1 states that films and television shows themselves, not their researchers, regularly use the method of listing credits. Choice B is incorrect. It can be inferred from Text 2 that when video games do feature credits, they have essentially the same function as credits in film and television—namely, to identify the individuals who worked on a particular production. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would characterize video game credits as differing in purpose from film and television credits. Choice C is incorrect because, as Text 2 explains, credits are not consistently used in video games. Therefore, it is unlikely that the author of Text 1 would argue that scholars of the medium discussed in this text—video games—rely more heavily on credits than scholars of film and television, two mediums where credits consistently appear. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion of imported goods and consumer prices. In this context, "nullify" most nearly means negate or undermine. The text indicates that importing goods to a country can reduce consumer prices in that country, then cautions that the costs of transporting goods within the country is also a factor. These transportation costs likely raise the prices that must be paid by people who live far from the ports of entry. Therefore, the intranational transportation costs could nullify the price advantages to consumers of importing goods.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "denigrate" would most nearly mean disparage or deny the importance of. Since transportation costs would not be capable of denying the importance of price advantages, it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs denigrate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "underestimate" would most nearly mean predict a lower value for, or to undervalue, someone or something. Though transportation costs might be undervalued, they cannot themselves undervalue something else, so it would not make sense to state that intranational transportation costs underestimate the price advantages of importing goods. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "misconstrue" would most nearly mean misunderstand. Since transport costs are not capable of understanding, it would not make sense to claim that intranational transportation costs misconstrue the price advantages of importing goods.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Carmen Lomas Garza’s artistic process. In this context, "inspired by" means influenced by or motivated by. The text refers to how, regardless of the scale of the work, Garza uses her memories of Texas and details from California to create her art. If Garza is basing her work on her direct experiences, then they play a part in her artistic process. This context thus suggests that Garza’s art is inspired by the experiences of her childhood in Texas and her current life in California.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make logical sense to indicate that Garza is "complimented by"—or praised by—something inanimate such as direct experience. Choice B is incorrect because describing Garza as "uncertain about"—or unsure or doubtful of—direct experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza were unsure of her experiences, that would suggest that she couldn’t recall them, and Garza wouldn’t be able to represent direct experience in her art if she were uncertain of the memories or details. Choice C is incorrect because describing Garza as "unbothered by"—or uninterested in—her experience would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about Garza’s artistic process. The text indicates that Garza’s art comes from memories of her childhood in Texas and details of her surroundings in California.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined lines in the text as a whole. In the opening line of the text, the speaker describes wandering in "alien lands," which establishes that the speaker is traveling in unfamiliar territory. In the underlined lines, the speaker describes "billows" (large waves) rolling in the soul, which suggests that the speaker feels inner turmoil. The underlined lines go on to associate these rolling billows with voices calling to the speaker from the speaker’s "native strands," or homeland, indicating that thoughts of home are prompting the emotional experience these lines describe. Taken together, the imagery in the underlined lines thus implies that the speaker feels a deep emotional connection to, or pull toward, home while traveling in an unfamiliar place.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the text’s first line states that the speaker is traveling and the underlined lines indicate that the speaker experiences an emotional pull toward home, neither the underlined lines nor the text as a whole establishes an enthusiasm about the current travels that conflicts with a growing urge to return home. The text’s description of the lands the speaker is traveling in focuses on their artificial quality, stating, "Nature her prerogative resigns / To Man," which doesn’t suggest enthusiasm but rather a sense of detachment or even critique. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined lines don’t address uncertainty about maintaining links with relatives in distant places. In the underlined lines, the speaker expresses a sense of connection to the speaker’s homeland ("native strands") but doesn’t refer to any family members the speaker may have there or to concerns about maintaining any familial ties. Choice D is incorrect because the poem doesn’t indicate that the speaker has returned home after an absence. Rather, the speaker explicitly states, "I wander among the hills of alien lands," establishing that the current setting is a foreign place. Moreover, the underlined lines express a sense of connection with, or pull toward, a distant homeland, not a sense of longing for how that homeland or any other location once felt.</p>

<p>The live music festival business is growing in event size and genre variety. With so many consumer options, organizers are finding ways to cement festival attendance as a special experience worth sharing. This phenomenon is linked to the growing “experiential economy,” where many find it gratifying to purchase lived experiences. To ensure a profitable event, venues need to consider the overall consumer experience, not just the band lineup.</p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>
<p>Music festival appearances are becoming a more important part of musicians’ careers. One factor in this shift is the rising use of streaming services that allow access to huge numbers of songs for a monthly fee, subsequently reducing sales of full-length albums. With this shift in consumer behavior, musicians are increasingly dependent on revenue from live performances.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. Both authors mention how consumer behaviors have shifted, and how this affects different aspects of the music industry. Text 1 states that consumers enjoy purchasing “lived experiences,” and that this influences how organizers design music festivals. Text 2 states that consumers are using streaming services more, and that this reduces album sales and increases the importance of live performances for musicians. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Neither text claims that consumers prefer streaming to festivals, or that these are mutually exclusive options. Text 1 implies that festivals are popular and profitable, and Text 2 never suggests that streaming services diminish the demand for live music. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 1, which identifies music festivals as just one example of a broader trend of purchasing “lived experiences.” Text 2 doesn’t mention growing interest in purchasing experiences, in the music industry or otherwise. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text establishes a cause/effect relationship between the demand for festivals and the demand for streaming platforms. Text 1 does not mention streaming platforms at all, and Text 2 does not imply that streaming platforms benefit from the popularity of festivals. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. "Stimulated" means "encouraged interest or increased activity in." Because the newspapers discussed the benefits of westward migration and "inspired readers to relocate," we can infer that they encouraged people to move west.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. "Assigned" means "gave a job or duty." Newspapers do not have the power to assign people to move west, although they can encourage it. Choice C is incorrect. "Opposed" means "disapproved of." We can tell that this isn’t the case, because the newspapers discussed "the easy fortunes and high salaries miners could make in California" and "inspired readers to relocate." Choice D is incorrect. "Disregarded" means "ignored." If the newspapers are writing about the west and "inspir[ing] readers to relocate," they can’t be ignoring it at the same time.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of self-government among the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. In this context, “implement” means to carry out or put into effect. The text states that the National Council generates laws, while the principal chief and cabinet officials are responsible for “devising policies and administering services in accordance with” those laws. This context suggests that the principal chief and cabinet officials implement the laws: they put the laws into effect by creating policies and administering services that accord with those laws. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because “presume” in this context would mean to assume based on incomplete information, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet officials either made assumptions about the content of the laws or had incomplete information about them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “improvise” would mean to create something without preparation, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet officials create policies and administer services without advance preparation. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the principal chief and cabinet officials “mimic,” or imitate, the laws generated by the National Council. To mimic laws would mean to generate new laws that are imitations of existing laws, but the text indicates that the National Council, not the principal chief and cabinet officials, is responsible for generating laws. Instead of generating laws, the principal chief and cabinet officials put laws into effect by “devising policies and administering services in accordance with” the laws. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sara not only could tell stories, but she adored telling them. When she sat or stood in the midst of a circle and began to <span aria-label="Referenced Content" role="region"><u>invent</u></span> wonderful things, her green eyes grew big and shining, her cheeks flushed, and, without knowing that she was doing it, she began to act and made what she told lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of her voice.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, "invent" most nearly means create or make up. The text begins by stating that Sara likes to tell stories and thoroughly enjoys telling them. The rest of the text describes how she looks and acts when she invents, or creates, "wonderful things" in her stories ("what she told").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Sara makes up "wonderful things," nothing suggests that she does so to mislead, or intentionally deceive, others; there is no reason to assume that Sara’s listeners don’t know that she’s creating the stories she shares. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is disguising, or trying to cover up or conceal, "wonderful things" when she tells stories; rather, she is creating them and presenting them in ways that make them "lovely or alarming" for her listeners. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Sara is discovering, or unexpectedly finding, "wonderful things" in the stories she loves to tell; rather, that she is making things up as she tells the stories.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "Asserted" means "stated confidently." Eastlake "did not hesitate to publish reviews going against popular opinion," so we can assume that she was confident in sharing her opinions.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. "Exposed" means "made visible by uncovering" and, when talking about ideas, tends to be used in relation to uncovering the truth. Eastlake was sharing an opinion, not uncovering a truth. Choice C is incorrect. "Discovered" means "found," but Eastlake was writing an opinion essay. She was writing her own opinion, not "discovering" a new universal truth. Choice D is incorrect. "Doubted" means "didn’t believe in." We’re told that Eastlake "questioned" the idea that photography could be fine art. Placing "doubted" in the blank would actually suggest that Eastlake argued that photos were valuable for creativity and not for information, which is the opposite of what we were told she believes.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of delivering biomolecules to plant cells. In this context, “overcome” means to succeed in dealing with an obstacle. The text suggests that although it’s difficult to move biomolecules through plant cell walls, Landry and her colleagues have shown that carbon nanotubes may be useful, since they can cross cell walls. This context conveys that Landry and her colleagues think it’s possible, using carbon nanotubes, to succeed in dealing with the obstacle of transmitting biomolecules to plant cells. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “conceptualize,” or form an idea of, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells. The text presents this difficulty as a known problem that Landry and her colleagues think they may have solved, not as a mysterious occurrence that they have yet to form ideas about. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to successfully deal with the problem of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells, not that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to “neglect,” or simply to disregard and ignore the problem. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “illustrate,” or demonstrate, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells by using carbon nanotubes. According to the text, carbon nanotubes allow molecules to be transmitted to plant cells—something that is otherwise difficult to do. The text therefore presents carbon nanotubes as a way of possibly solving a problem, not as a means of demonstrating the problem. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about the relationship between fine art and fashion. As used in this context, “intersect” means to connect or overlap. The text indicates that Jamie Okuma challenges the position held by critics because her work can be seen at an art museum and can be bought by the public from her online boutique. The text also presents the critics’ view as being influenced by a perception that fine artists create works that are “timeless” and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase. This context suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion tend not to overlap—in other words, that they rarely intersect. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that critics contend that fine art and fashion rarely “prevail,” or prove to be triumphant or widespread. The text indicates that Okuma is an example of an artist who demonstrates that it’s possible to make fine art that is also available to the public as fashion. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that fine art and fashion rarely “succumb,” or surrender. The text establishes that unlike what critics believe, Okuma creates works that are in art museums and available for the public to purchase, suggesting that critics believe fine art and fashion rarely overlap, not that they rarely succumb. Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely “diverge,” or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text presents Okuma’s work as both fine art and fashion, thereby undermining what the critics assert. This suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely intersect rather than that the two rarely diverge. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of manul cats. The text states that manul cats live in "out-of-the-way parts of Asia" (citing the famously remote Mount Everest as an example) and indicates that it is difficult to research the cats because of the location of their habitats. By emphasizing that the habitats are remote in relation to humans, the text conveys that being "distant from," or far from, large groups of humans makes manul cats challenging to study.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because saying that the habitats of manul cats are "full of large populations of humans" would indicate that the cats cohabitate with many humans, which would directly contradict the text’s claim that the cats live in "out-of-the-way" areas. Choice B is incorrect because the missing words describe an aspect of manul cats’ habitats, or the areas where they live, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that areas could be "drawn to," or attracted by, large groups of humans. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "responsible for" would mean either having an obligation to care for something or being the cause of something, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that the habitats of manul cats (the areas where the cats live) would need to care for humans or that the habitats somehow created large human populations.</p>

          <p>Vadamalai Elangovan and Ganapathi Marimuthu showed that high moonlight intensity inhibits the activity of the greater short-nosed fruit bat (<em>Cynopterus sphinx</em>), a result explicable in terms of benefits and costs: greater lunar intensity may not enable the bats to increase foraging success enough to offset the higher chance of detection by predatory owls or hawks. Most other nocturnal mammals respond to lunar intensity variations similarly to greater short-nosed fruit bats, but mongoose lemurs (<em>Eulemur mongoz</em>) display the opposite pattern, as their heavy reliance on visual foraging results in a different balance of reward and risk.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by describing a study’s finding about greater short-nosed fruit bats—namely, that high moonlight intensity inhibits the bats’ activity—and also accounts for that finding, stating that this occurs because the potential increase in foraging success that greater lunar intensity enables doesn’t offset these bats’ increased vulnerability to predators (whose vision is also implied to become more acute under intense moonlight). The text goes on to characterize this finding as representative of a general pattern, stating that many nocturnal mammals behave similarly in response to changes in lunar intensity. The text concludes by describing an exception to this pattern, explaining that mongoose lemurs display an opposite tendency because they rely heavily on visual foraging. This strategy presumably would allow them to derive more benefit from greater lunar intensity than many other nocturnal mammals would, resulting in a "different balance of reward and risk" than exists for other nocturnal mammals. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description and account of a finding, a characterization of that finding as representative of a pattern, and then a description and account of an exception to that pattern.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses two different responses to variations in moonlight intensity, explaining that as moonlight intensity increases, greater short-nosed fruit bats and many other nocturnal mammals decrease their foraging activity but mongoose lemurs increase their foraging activity, it doesn’t leave one of these responses unexplained. The text accounts for both the typical response to increased lunar intensity (reduced activity due to predation risk) and the exception (increased activity due to a reliance on visual foraging) by making reference to a cost-benefit framework. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text presents a study′s finding about the effect of increased lunar intensity on greater short-nosed fruit bats’ activity before going on to contrast this behavior with the fact that mongoose lemurs display the opposite response to increased lunar intensity, the text doesn’t explicitly invoke other studies and doesn’t attribute this difference in observed behavior to the fact that the study of greater short-nosed fruit bats used different methods than studies of mongoose lemurs did. Rather, the text explains that the different observed behaviors can be attributed to differences in species’ foraging strategies. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text characterizes the behavior of mongoose lemurs in response to increased lunar intensity as an exception to a pattern of behavior observed in other nocturnal mammal species, this exception doesn’t cast any doubt on the explanation that is offered for the general pattern observed among other species. Instead, the text uses the same cost-benefit framework to explain why increased lunar intensity is associated with decreased activity by greater short-nosed fruit bats and other nocturnal mammals but with increased activity by mongoose lemurs.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of ways to detect people through walls. In this context, "inexpensive" means less costly or low in price. The passage describes two kinds of methods that can be used to "detect objects or people through walls": radar and sonar, and changes to the Wi-Fi technology used in smartphones. The word "comparatively" before the blank indicates that the best answer would be one that helps to describe a comparison between the two. Radar and sonar are described as "costly," while the method that uses Wi-Fi technology is described as "cheap"; therefore, it would be comparatively affordable, or inexpensive.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that a small modification to the smartphones that many consumers already own would presumably result in consumers using that technology to detect objects or people through walls more regularly, or frequently; therefore, it would not be true that such technology would be comparatively infrequent, or uncommon. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that either radar and sonar or changes to smartphone Wi-Fi technology are capable of being misunderstood or mistaken for something else; therefore, it would not make sense to describe changes to Wi-Fi smartphone technology as comparatively unmistakable, or indisputable. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that a small modification to the smartphones that many consumers already own and carry with them would be more functional or practical than radar and sonar, not more impractical, or unrealistic.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to illustrate two approaches that Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve political representation for their communities. The text begins by explaining that one approach is exemplified by Indigenous politicians in the United States who, in an effort to ensure that the interests of their communities are represented in government, joined preexisting political parties and were subsequently elected to Congress. The text goes on to highlight a second approach adopted by Indigenous leaders in Canada and several Latin American countries: rather than joining established political parties, many Indigenous politicians in these countries have instead formed their own parties to promote candidates for office who support causes that are important to their communities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text’s focus is on the contrasting approaches adopted by different Indigenous political movements in different countries; thus, it isn’t accurate to say that the text traces the history of one political movement. Moreover, the text only discusses examples from 2000 to 2021, a relatively short period of time; therefore, it provides very little in the way of discussion of larger historical developments, nor does it make any predictions about how these movements might continue to develop in the future. Choice B is incorrect because the text never urges Indigenous politicians in the US to alter their strategy of striving for representation through the established political parties, nor does it suggest that this strategy is inferior to that of Indigenous politicians in Canada and Latin America, who have formed their own parties. In fact, the text notes that both strategies have resulted in the election of Indigenous politicians to national governments. Choice D is incorrect because the text never suggests that Indigenous politicians in the US have influenced those in Canada and Latin America; instead, it stresses how Indigenous politicians’ approach toward achieving representation in the US government has differed from the approach Indigenous politicians have taken to achieve representation in national governments elsewhere in the Americas. </p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator describes how Joe responds to being in “the metropolis”: he’s excited and “wild with enthusiasm.” He also envies the young fellows who walk by because, dressed as they are, they look as if they have somewhere special to go. The text contrasts this new place with the place Joe comes from, where apparently there wasn’t as much to do. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Joe’s reaction to a new environment. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to why Joe has moved.

The narrator describes young men passing by in the evening and then recalls places worth going to at home—church and a few people’s houses—but there’s no explicit comparison made nor is a time of day mentioned for these events back home. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t support the idea that Joe feels regret over leaving home. Instead, Joe is described as “wild with enthusiasm” at being in the city. Joe’s home is mentioned, but only to compare it unfavorably with the city. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of oysters and ocean recordings. As used in this context, "responsive" means reacting positively. The text presents a finding and describes it as suggesting that healthy ocean sounds may encourage oyster larvae to establish a reef (a permanent home): groups of oyster larvae that heard recorded sounds of a healthy oyster reef were two times more likely to show signs of forming their own reef than groups that heard different ocean recordings were. This context conveys that the groups that heard healthy reef sounds had a more positive reaction than the other groups did—that is, they were the most responsive.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to become "inactive," or to stop engaging in work or activity. Instead, the text conveys that the groups that heard those sounds were observed engaging in activity: they were two times more likely to create a reef (a permanent home) than groups that heard different ocean sounds were. Choice C is incorrect because describing the groups of oyster larvae that heard sounds of a healthy oyster reef as most "liked," or regarded with pleasure, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that a study found that healthy reef sounds may encourage groups of oyster larvae to form reefs (permanent homes), not on the idea that some of the groups in the study were liked more than others. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that hearing sounds of a healthy oyster reef caused some groups of oyster larvae to be "distressed," or to experience difficulty or begin to decline. Instead, the text indicates that the sounds increased the likelihood that groups of larvae would establish a reef (a permanent home), suggesting that the sounds had a positive effect on the larvae.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "determine" most nearly means choose or decide. The text indicates that Mr. Ryder "had made up his mind" to ask a woman to marry him but had not yet "spoken"—that is, he had not yet asked her. The text also indicates that Mr. Ryder "decided" to throw a party for the woman and ask her during it. This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, what Mr. Ryder had to do was determine, or choose, the time to do it.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "determine" doesn’t mean influence, or affect or control. The text isn’t indicating that Mr. Ryder is controlling time itself; such a thing isn’t possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose. Choice C is incorrect. The text focuses on Mr. Ryder’s plan to ask a woman to marry him and his decision about when to ask her. This context conveys that after making up his mind to propose, Mr. Ryder had to choose the time, not that he had to demonstrate, or show, the time; it’s not clear what it would mean to demonstrate a time. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "determine" doesn’t mean measure, or control with careful restraint. The text isn’t indicating that Mr. Ryder is carefully controlling time itself; such a thing isn’t possible. Rather, the text conveys that after making up his mind to ask a woman to marry him, Mr. Ryder had to make another decision about his own actions by selecting a time to propose; it’s Mr. Ryder’s decision that is measured, not the time he eventually chooses.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Cole’s book <em>Blind Spot</em>. In this context, “enthusiasm for” means excitement about. The text explains that <em>Blind Spot </em>consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose—two elements that correspond to Cole’s passions, identified in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole’s excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling “indifference to” his two passions wouldn’t make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn’t care about photography or writing—in which case they wouldn’t be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “concern about,” or uneasiness about, his passions. The text’s use of the word “culminates” indicates that <em>Blind Spot </em>represents a triumphant climax of Cole’s passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels “surprise at,” or astonished by, his passions. The text indicates that Cole’s feeling about his passions “culminates” in a book that “evocatively” combines photographs and writing, suggesting that Cole has a long-standing and skillful relationship to his passions, not that he is startled by them. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “drew” most nearly means pulled. In the text, the speaker stands at a window, looking out on a landscape at night. The speaker then “drew the shades far down, crept into bed.” That is, the speaker pulled down, or lowered, the shades until they were completely shut before going to sleep. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “drew” can refer to draining or removing liquid, especially water, as when someone draws water from a well, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice C is incorrect. In some contexts, “drew” can be used to describe how a person or thing inspires, or elicits, a response from someone, as when a performer draws applause from an audience. But in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. Choice D is incorrect. Although “drew” has several meanings, including sketched, or illustrated with a pen or pencil, in this context it refers to the speaker pulling down window shades for the night. </p>

          <p>During Rome’s republican period, which ended in the first century BCE, libraries were predominantly owned by wealthy individuals who tightly controlled access to their book collections. The first public library became available in Rome in 28 BCE and was soon followed by one commissioned by Emperor Augustus.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text describes two types of libraries in first-century BCE Rome—private libraries controlled by wealthy individuals, and the public libraries like that commissioned by Emperor Augustus—and then notes that "these two traditions aren’t as distinct as they seem." It explains that both private-library owners and the emperor saw their libraries as "extensions of their personal patronage, just on vastly differing scales," because the emperor’s patronage extended to the whole citizenry of Rome. Thus, both private and public libraries in ancient Rome were fundamentally tied to relevant principles of patronage.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text mentions that Rome’s republican period only to say that it "ended in the first century BCE," thus it doesn’t support any conclusions about possible occurrences "throughout Rome’s republican period." Choice B is incorrect. The text neither discusses "early imperial leaders in Rome," nor whether their level of influence was appropriate. Rather it discusses the end of "Rome’s republican period" in relation to libraries, who created them, and who got to use them without passing judgment on propriety. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Rome’s republican period "ended in the first century BCE," a period that also saw the first public library come into use (28 BCE), nothing in the text suggests that private libraries disappeared at that time.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because is accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by declaring that although a song is "but a little thing," or seemingly insignificant, singing it brings joy and gives the speaker of the text "zest," or excitement, in "hours of toil." The remainder of the text explores the idea that as night is falling, singing allows the speaker to feel that "all is well." Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey how engaging in song makes the speaker feel.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions a shepherd, it neither indicates that the shepherd is singing nor does it compare the shepherd to the speaker. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that the speaker works hard, engaging in "hours of toil," and it can be inferred that the speaker likely lives in a rural area, since cows and a cowbell can be heard nearby. However, the text does not suggest that the speaker is a farmer or feels excited about farming. Moreover, the shepherd in the text is not a literal reference to someone who herds sheep but instead a figurative description of the moon as the shepherd of the stars. Choice D is incorrect because in the text, the speaker is singing a song, not listening to others sing one. Moreover, the text describes the feelings that the speaker has when singing a song, not the song itself.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the artistic styles that have influenced Cannon’s work. As used in this context, “disparate” means distinct or dissimilar. The text indicates that a tension exists among the styles that have influenced Cannon’s work and goes on to describe how those styles differ: classic European portraiture favors realism, American pop art uses vivid colors, and intertribal flatstyle rejects the use of shading and perspective to achieve depth. This context suggests that the styles that have influenced Cannon’s work are disparate. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon’s artwork, so it wouldn’t make sense to say that the influences are “complementary,” or that they complete one another or make up for one another’s deficiencies. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to characterize Cannon’s influences as “unknown,” or not familiar; it’s clear that the influences are known because the text goes on to list them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon’s work, not that they are  “interchangeable,” or capable of being used in one another’s place. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences of the text establish that in California, houses were heated by building fires year-round. The underlined portion then indicates that the fires didn’t merely provide physical warmth: they also represented being "home" and feeling protected. The underlined portion thus illustrates that a fire provides comfort beyond physical warmth.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t summarize information that came before it. Whereas the previous two sentences describe fires’ ability to provide physical warmth to homes, the underlined portion focuses on the psychological comfort the fires offered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text’s second sentence mentions that fires were built in the summer because fog came in, which may have cooled the house, this detail isn’t the focus of the underlined portion. Instead, the underlined portion indicates that fires were built for reasons beyond physical warmth: to create a sense of being home and safe. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion focuses on the emotional significance the author places on having a fire going inside the home. There is no indication that the author feels equally comfortable without a fire present.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, "conceivable" most nearly means capable of being thought of or imagined. The text describes a journey that, despite being "insignificant in distance," was "by no means an easy one" because of the variety of obstacles that "nature had determined to throw…in the way." To emphasize the difficulty of the journey, the author portrays nature as actively scheming to present travelers with every obstacle that can be thought of—i.e., every imaginable obstacle.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "conceivable" does not mean obvious, or evident. Instead, by referring to "every conceivable obstacle," the text suggests a wide variety of challenges by evoking all the potential difficulties nature could present, not just those that the travelers might reasonably expect or foresee. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "conceivable" does not mean straightforward, or easy to negotiate. The text is not indicating that the obstacles were simple to respond to and overcome. Rather, the text suggests that a wide range of obstacles made the journey difficult. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "conceivable" does not mean uninterrupted. Although the text suggests that the obstacles were frequent and numerous, it does not emphasize the obstacles’ continuity; instead, the text conveys their unexpected variety and range.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is known for the colorful murals painted on many of its buildings. The densest collection of murals is found on Balmy Alley in the Mission District neighborhood. In the 1970s, Latina artists painted vivid scenes of community life on walls along this block. As the original murals have faded, later generations of artists have painted new ones over them. As a result, Balmy Alley has become a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit, with its murals reflecting changes in the cultural life of the city.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by briefly stating that San Francisco is known for its murals, then transitions to a discussion of a single collection of murals, which is found on Balmy Alley in the city’s Mission District. The text explains that the murals in this area were originally created in the 1970s, then observes that they have changed over time: as some have faded through the decades, others have been painted in their place. The text ends by emphasizing that these murals are significant because they reflect San Francisco’s artistic spirit and cultural life. Therefore, the text provides an overview of the history and importance of the Balmy Alley murals. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it can be inferred from the text that there are murals in other areas of San Francisco besides Balmy Alley, the text doesn’t specifically discuss murals in other areas or compare the murals of Balmy Alley to those in other areas. Choice C is incorrect. By observing that some of the murals of Balmy Alley have been replaced due to fading, the text implies that murals can decay, but it never urges readers to protect this specific collection of murals—or any murals elsewhere in San Francisco, for that matter. Indeed, by describing the ever-changing murals of Balmy Alley as “a living showcase of San Francisco’s artistic spirit,” the text emphasizes the positive aspects of the fact that the original Balmy Alley murals have faded and been replaced with new murals. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the rise of mural painting in San Francisco generally or note when this occurred. The only historical development of the 1970s mentioned in the text is the origin of the murals in a specific area of the city: Balmy Alley in the Mission District. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it accurately states the text’s main purpose. The poem begins with the speaker urging a child to “go forth” with her encouragement (“my heart’s desire”). The speaker goes on to suggest that new experiences (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) lie ahead for the son that “life is calling” him to seek out. Thus, the main purpose is to encourage a child to embrace the experiences available to him in his life. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the speaker encourages the child to pursue new experiences (“Great reaches”) without knowing exactly what those experiences will be (“yet unknown”) or suggesting that they should match the speaker’s own accomplishments. Choice B is incorrect because the speaker focuses on positive possibilities for her son (“Great reaches, yet unknown”) and her enthusiastic encouragement to embrace those possibilities (“life is calling you!”), while there is no mention of raising a child or associated struggles. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker frames the possibilities for her son in a positive light when she says that “great reaches, yet unknown” are waiting for him, and this positive outlook for the son is consistent throughout the text. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of businesses being featured in <em>The Illustrated History of San Mateo County</em>. In this context, "advantageous" means beneficial or providing a favorable position. The text explains that being included in the book "suggested that a business was an important part of the community," and it can be inferred that an enhanced reputation within the local community would benefit a business, commercially or otherwise. This context supports the idea that being featured in this publication would be advantageous.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "risky" would suggest that being featured in <em>The Illustrated History of San Mateo County</em> might have negative consequences for a business. However, the text implies only positive outcomes since inclusion indicated importance within the local community. Choice B is incorrect because "misleading" would mean deceptive or deliberately giving a wrong impression, but the text doesn’t indicate there was something deceptive about being featured in <em>The Illustrated History of San Mateo County</em>; rather, it suggests that inclusion indicated community importance. Choice D is incorrect because "unremarkable" would mean common or ordinary, which doesn’t make sense in context. The text suggests that inclusion in <em>The Illustrated History of San Mateo County</em> instead conferred a special status on a business by conveying its importance in the local community.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "soft" most nearly means gentle. The text portrays Alice speaking about the snow falling against the window, describing it as sounding "nice" and similar to someone "kissing the window." These details most strongly suggest that Alice thinks the sound made by the snow falling against the window is gentle.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, "gentle" can mean sensitive, or caring about others’ feelings, that isn’t the meaning in this context; it doesn’t make sense to say that Alice thinks the sound of the snow cares about anything. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is shapeless, or lacks a definite shape; she isn’t indicating how anything looks or feels but, rather, is describing how "nice" and gentle the snow sounds. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Alice thinks the sound of the snow is bland, or uninteresting; rather, she notices the sound and comments on how "nice" it is.</p>

Choice C is incorrect because the text does not draw any comparison between nature and human emotions; it does not refer to human emotions at all. Choice D is incorrect.

<p>On April 26th, 1777, Sybil Ludington rode 40 miles by horse through Putnam County, New York, to gather up local militia. British forces were burning nearby Danbury, Connecticut, and Ludington wanted to rally rebel troops to meet them. Although she was only 16 years old at the time, her brave feat made Ludington one of the heroes of the American Revolution.

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. Both authors agree that Ludington’s story has been widely celebrated and revered by Americans, even if they disagree on its accuracy. Text 1 states that Ludington has inspired postage stamps, statues, and TV series, and Text 2 states that many articles and books have been written about her. Thus, both authors acknowledge the popularity of Ludington’s story. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Neither author claims that Ludington had a significant impact on the war. Text 1 doesn’t mention how Ludington’s ride affected the war overall, and Text 2 suggests that Ludington’s ride may have been exaggerated or invented over time. Choice B is incorrect. Neither author claims that Ludington’s route has been verified by historians. Text 1 claims she rode 40 miles through Putnam County, but doesn’t cite any sources for this information, while Text 2 suggests the ride may not have even happened. Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads text 2. Neither author claims that Ludington was not a real person, only that her ride may not have happened. Both authors seem to treat Ludington as a genuine historical figure. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portions in the text as a whole.

In context, the metaphorical language comparing attempts to refine concepts of art to imprecisely cutting wood with an inadequate axe serves to emphasize how much the individuals at the gathering struggled to articulate, or express, their thoughts; indeed, the text explains that the individuals couldn’t quite grasp why their statements had gone awry and tended to try to rectify, or correct, them in continued discussion after they sat down.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portions characterize aspects of the young artists and intellectuals’ attempts to present their general views of art more clearly, not their views of the reputation of a certain artwork; the text never mentions any specific artwork or its reputation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the underlined portions refer to a physical activity—cutting wood with an axe—the descriptions are metaphorical rather than literal. The text isn’t describing people constructing works of art, large-scale or otherwise; rather, it’s describing people talking at a gathering, using the idea of imprecisely cutting wood with an inadequate axe to suggest that each individual struggled when trying to present their view of art more clearly. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portions do provide a reason for the young artists and intellectuals’ discontent, the text focuses on the fact that they were each dissatisfied with their own statements, not on how they felt about the group’s full conversation about art. Instead, the text explains that each individual tried to present their view of art more clearly but struggled (as if imprecisely cutting wood with an inadequate axe), couldn’t grasp what went awry, and then felt the need to rectify, or correct, what they had just said. It’s possible that the individuals were also discontented with the group’s conversation overall, but neither the underlined portions nor the text as a whole suggest that.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of studies of altitude’s effect on blood chemistry. In this context, “paucity of” means lack of. In describing the inspiration behind Al-Sweedan and Alhaj’s research, the text uses the word “though” to suggest a contrasting relationship between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. This contrasting relationship and the text’s use of the word “many” provide context suggesting that there are few, if any, examples of the second type of study, whereas there are numerous examples of the first type. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “quarrel about,” or open disagreement about, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that the contrast between the two types of studies involves the extent to which researchers broadly agree or disagree about the contents of either type. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “profusion of,” or great abundance of, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. Rather than logically completing this contrast, “profusion of” would indicate that the two types of studies are similar in terms of amount, with many examples existing of both types. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context for there to be a “verisimilitude in,” or appearance of truth in, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. The text’s use of the words “though” and “many” suggests a contrasting relationship in terms of amount between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. There’s nothing in the text to suggest that the contrast between the two types of studies involves the extent to which either type of study presents an appearance of truth. </p>

          <p>Musician Joni Mitchell, who is also a painter, uses images she creates for her album covers to emphasize ideas expressed in her music. For the cover of her album <em>Turbulent Indigo</em> (1994), Mitchell painted a striking self-portrait that closely resembles Vincent van Gogh’s <em>Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear</em> (1889). The image calls attention to the album’s title song, in which Mitchell sings about the legacy of the postimpressionist painter. In that song, Mitchell also hints that she feels a strong artistic connection to Van Gogh—an idea that is reinforced by her imagery on the cover.</p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it accurately describes the organization of the elements within the text. The text begins with the claim that Joni Mitchell’s album covers use images she creates in order to emphasize ideas embedded in her albums. It then goes on to provide an example of how Mitchell’s self-portrait on the cover of <em>Turbulent Indigo </em>resembles a painting by Van Gogh, which the text indicates helps emphasize the strong connection Mitchell feels toward Van Gogh, a connection that is also expressed in the album’s title song. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because there are no references in the text to artists other than Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text that calls attention to any similarities or differences between Joni Mitchell and Van Gogh. Instead, it mentions that Mitchell feels a strong “artistic connection” to Van Gogh. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses the cover before referring to any songs, and it only references one song from the album not all the songs. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text begins by discussing the promise of the future, with positive references to renewal such as “new roads,” “new beating of the drum,” and “fresh seeing.” But with the “new sun,” the text continues, there will still be “the same backs bending” and “the same sad feet” drumming, indicating that these difficulties will follow people into this new day. The poem thus considers both the rewards and challenges associated with the repetitiveness of human life. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t say anything about how memorable activities are, let alone compare the memorability of activities completed at different times of the day. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text contrasts hope with difficulty, it does not compare the relative frequency of joyful feelings with that of sad feelings. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no distinction between the experiences of individuals and the experiences of their communities. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of ectomycorrhizae relationships. In this context, “reciprocates” means responds in kind or degree. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually beneficial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. In other words, each organism provides the same kind of benefit it receives: the tree provides a nutrient (carbon) for the fungus and the fungus reciprocates by helping the tree to absorb more of another nutrient (nitrogen). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text emphasizes that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Nothing in the text suggests that the fungus “overreacts,” or responds too strongly, by allowing the tree to be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient. Choice C is incorrect because “retaliates” means responds to a harmful action with a similarly harmful action. The text indicates that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats is “mutually beneficial” and involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other, not that the relationship is one in which the organisms harm one another. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, “deviates” would mean departs from an established course or norm. The text explains that the relationship between certain fungi and trees in some habitats involves a “symbiotic exchange” in which each organism helps the other access an important nutrient. Because the relationship involves benefits for both the fungus and the tree, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the fungus deviates by helping the tree be better able to absorb a beneficial nutrient. </p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of <em><span lang="fr">carte de visite</span></em> photos. To "popularize" a technology is to allow it to be used and appreciated widely. The text explains that unlike the photos produced by earlier forms of photographic technology, <em><span lang="fr">carte de visite</span></em> photos were inexpensive and could easily be obtained by "everyday people," who enjoyed exchanging the images.

Choice B is incorrect. The text establishes that large numbers of people enjoyed using <em><span lang="fr">carte de visite</span></em> photos, so it can be inferred that these photos caused photography to be praised, or celebrated. However, it wouldn’t make sense to say that inanimate objects—in this case, photos—had praised photography; instead, <em><span lang="fr">carte de visite</span></em> consumers themselves would have praised it.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it best states how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence states that Tule geese typically take four days to migrate south. Then in the next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, the text describes the first part of that journey, which begins with the geese flying over the Gulf of Alaska while keeping about 100 miles from the Canadian shore. The rest of the text details the remainder of the geese’s typical journey and then mentions circumstances in 2020 that resulted in the geese taking an unusually long time to complete it. Thus, the underlined portion describes part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text concludes by stating that in 2020, Tule geese took twice as long to complete their typical migration, which suggests a change in their usual flight behavior, the underlined portion doesn’t discuss this. Instead, the underlined portion describes the first part of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration journey over the Gulf of Alaska. Choice B is incorrect. Although the sentence containing the underlined portion mentions that Tule geese breed in Alaska, the underlined portion doesn’t explain why the geese breed in that location. Rather, the text mentions Alaska to explain that it’s the starting point of the Tule geese’s typical winter migration. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t discuss any other birds that migrate south for the winter. In fact, the text is only concerned with the migration of Tule geese.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Booker T. Whatley. In this context, “hinder” means hold back or obstruct. The text explains that Whatley encouraged farms to allow customers on site to pick their own produce for a fee. He did so despite critics’ concerns that the customers would never pay to do so. This context establishes that the critics’ concerns didn’t hinder Whatley’s efforts to promote the practice. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text indicates that critics’ skepticism of the idea that customers would pay to pick their own produce didn’t have some effect on Whatley’s promotion of the practice. The text illustrates this assertion by describing Whatley’s “determined advocacy” for the practice. This context suggests that critics’ concerns didn’t obstruct Whatley’s efforts, not that critics’ concerns didn’t “enhance,” or increase or improve, Whatley’s efforts. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, “misrepresent” would mean portray inaccurately, and the text includes no information relevant to the issue of how Whatley’s efforts were portrayed by critics of the practice of charging customers to pick their own produce. Choice D is incorrect. The text indicates that critics’ skepticism of the idea that customers would pay to pick their own produce didn’t have some effect on Whatley’s promotion of the practice. The text illustrates this assertion by describing Whatley’s “determined advocacy” for the practice. This context suggests that critics’ concerns didn’t obstruct Whatley’s efforts, not that critics’ concerns didn’t “aggravate,” or irritate or make more severe, Whatley’s efforts. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the dating of Machu Picchu. In this context, "original" means first or initial. The text indicates that Lucy Salazar and her colleagues have determined the age of Machu Picchu and that the age differs from another estimate of the site’s age, explaining that the site is about 20 years older than scholars thought in 1911 when they initially encountered Machu Picchu. In other words, Salazar and her team found that the site’s age differs from the first estimate.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text’s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "genuine," or actual and true, while the one by Salazar’s team wasn’t, since the text treats the finding by Salazar’s team as true and as invalidating the earlier estimate ("it is approximately 20 years older than scholars thought"). Choice B is incorrect. The text’s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. It wouldn’t make sense to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "intentional," or done on purpose, while the one by Salazar’s team wasn’t; the text indicates that Salazar and her colleagues were deliberately using radiocarbon dating to study Machu Picchu. Choice C is incorrect. The text’s structure indicates that the missing word describes the estimate made by scholars when they first encountered Machu Picchu in 1911 in relation to the age determined by Salazar and her colleagues. There’s no reason to suggest that the estimate by earlier scholars was "independent," or not controlled by or affiliated with others, while the one by Salazar’s team wasn’t; there’s no mention of any outside influence on the work by Salazar and her team or by scholars in 1911.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole. The text’s subject is Beverly Glenn-Copeland’s 1986 album <em>Keyboard Fantasies</em>, notable for its innovative, experimental arrangements. According to the text, the album was not initially admired, but in recent years it has become popular among younger musicians. The underlined portion of the text mentions two of those musicians, Blood Orange and Moses Sumney, who “cite the album as an influence.” Therefore, the underlined portion of the text offers examples of younger musicians whose work has been impacted by <em>Keyboard Fantasies</em>. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because even though the underlined sentence states that Blood Orange and Moses Sumney were influenced by <em>Keyboard Fantasies</em>, it doesn’t say that all other musicians should also embrace the album’s experimental style. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that <em>Keyboard Fantasies</em> was not admired on its first release, the text doesn’t present any criticism of the album by younger musicians: it only presents two younger musicians who cite it as an influence. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t mention any differences between <em>Keyboard Fantasies</em> and the work of Blood Orange and Moses Sumney. </p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. In this context, "indulge" means treat with excessive leniency. The text states that according to historian Edward Gibbon, Marcus Aurelius, who was widely considered virtuous, had only a single character flaw: his mild temperament. The text suggests that because of this flaw, Marcus Aurelius had an overly permissive nature. This context, in turn, supports the idea that Marcus Aurelius treated the vices, or evils, of those around him with excessive leniency, indulging rather than punishing those vices.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While the text does state that Marcus Aurelius was widely considered virtuous, it gives no indication that he was inclined to "despise," or hate, others’ vices. Rather, the text suggests that he showed undue tolerance for these vices because of his overly permissive nature—that is, his inclination to allow others to do as they wished. Choice C is incorrect because the text’s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others’ vices, not that he tried to "moderate" those vices, or lessen their intensity. Choice D is incorrect because the text’s description of Marcus Aurelius as overly permissive suggests that he showed undue tolerance for others’ vices, not that he attempted to "criticize," or speak disapprovingly of, those vices.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of novelist Leon Forrest’s admiration of William Faulkner’s writing style. In this context, "imitation" means something that resembles or reproduces something else. The text states that Forrest admired Faulkner’s style and that anyone familiar with Faulkner’s style would be able to see the stylistic similarities between a particular passage in Forrest’s novel <em>Divine Days</em> and Faulkner’s writing, a fact that supports the idea that Forrest’s novel pays tribute to Faulkner by reproducing, or imitating, Faulkner’s style.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, a "forgetting" would mean an instance in which something is overlooked or not remembered. The text emphasizes Forrest’s admiration for Faulkner’s style and the fact that Forrest’s writing in some instances closely resembles Faulkner’s stylistically. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that in trying to pay tribute to Faulkner’s style, Forrest failed to remember it. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, a "rejection" would mean a dismissal of something as unworthy. The text emphasizes Forrest’s admiration for Faulkner’s writing style, stating that parts of Forrest’s writings indicate efforts to copy that style. It wouldn’t make sense therefore to suggest that Forrest had rejected or dismissed Faulkner’s style as unworthy. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, an "opinion" would mean a view or judgment. Although the text focuses on Forrest’s admiration of Faulkner, which suggests that Forrest had formed a positive judgment of Faulkner’s style, the word opinion wouldn’t make sense in this sentence: the sentence doesn’t say that the passage from Forrest’s novel expresses his view of Faulkner’s style; rather, it suggests that stylistically, the passage closely resembles, or imitates, Faulkner’s writing.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fossilized bones of the hominin known as Little Foot. As used in this context, “comparable to” would mean similar to. The text indicates that the relationship between the fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones of Little Foot and the clavicle and shoulder bones of “frequent climbers,” such as chimpanzees and gorillas, suggests that Little Foot had adapted to moving around in trees. This context suggests that the relationship between the fossilized bones of Little Foot and the bones of chimpanzees and gorillas is one of similarity—the Little Foot fossils are likely comparable to the modern ape bones. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because if the fossilized bones of Little Foot were “surpassed by,” or exceeded by or made inferior to, the bones of modern apes that are frequent climbers, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees. If anything, learning that Little Foot’s clavicle and shoulder bones were surpassed by those of chimpanzees and gorillas would suggest that Little Foot was poorly adapted to climbing. Choice C is incorrect because if Little Foot’s fossilized clavicle and shoulder bones were “independent of,” or not influenced by or affiliated with, the bones of modern apes that climb often, it wouldn’t suggest, as the text says, that Little Foot was adapted to moving around in trees. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that Little Foot’s fossilized bones date to 3.6 million years ago, so they couldn’t have been “obtained from,” or acquired from, the bones of modern apes.   </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the play’s effect on audiences. As used in this context, “rousing” means exciting or energizing. The text indicates that critics found the play to have “the opposite effect” on audiences of what the playwrights hoped for. The critics, the text says, thought the play was wearying rather than energizing to viewers. This context supports the idea that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be energizing, or rousing, to audiences. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be “multifaceted,” or be varied or have many aspects. The text indicates that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Multifaceted is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing. Choice B is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be “realistic,” or lifelike or sensible. The text says that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Realistic is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that the playwrights hoped live performances of the play would be subtle, or complex or understated. The text says that critics found the play to be wearying to audiences and that this was the opposite of what the playwrights hoped for. Subtle is not the opposite of wearying, but rousing is, which suggests that the playwrights hoped the play would be rousing. </p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "featured" most nearly means displayed. The text describes Nina’s fascination with a framed photograph. It then goes on to describe what the photograph showed, or displayed, which is a portrait of Nina’s great-great-grandmother Rosita as a young woman.

Choice C is incorrect because approved means expressed a favorable opinion of, and there’s nothing to suggest that the photograph of Nina’s great-great-grandmother has received approval or been viewed favorably, only that Nina is unable to stop looking at it. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the photograph Nina is fascinated with ignored, or refused to take notice of, Nina’s great-great-grandmother Rosita. Rather, the text indicates that the photograph was a portrait of Rosita.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ikeguchi’s model of bicycle supply. In this context, “saturated with” means thoroughly or completely supplied with. The text explains a problem encountered by some bicycle-sharing programs: users can return bicycles to different locations than where the users picked up the bicycles to start, which can result in a mismatch between bicycle supply (that is, where the bicycles are currently located) and user demand (that is, the locations where users are hoping to pick up bicycles). The text goes on to explain that Ikeguchi developed a way to identify when this mismatch is likely to occur. This context suggests that Ikeguchi’s method will show when it is likely that some locations have an insufficient supply and other locations, by implicit contrast, are saturated with bicycles. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some locations are “susceptible to,” or sensitive to or easily influenced by, bicycles. The text describes the phenomenon of bicycles being redistributed away from locations where users want them, not anything about those locations being influenced by the bicycles. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes situations in which some locations have an insufficient supply of bicycles because the bicycles have been relocated elsewhere, which suggests that the other locations have many bicycles, not that the other locations are “contingent on,” or dependent on, the bicycles. Nothing in the text suggests that the locations themselves depend on the bicycles for anything. Choice D is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that some locations are “depleted of,” or empty of, bicycles while others have an insufficient supply. The text describes situations in which bicycles have been relocated such that there is a mismatch between bicycle supply and user demand—the bicycles are no longer at the locations where users want to pick them up. This means that some locations do not have enough bicycles, while other locations must have many bicycles, not be depleted of bicycles.

<p>The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event is usually attributed solely to an asteroid impact near Chicxulub, Mexico. Some scientists argue that <span aria-label="Referenced Content" role="region"><u>volcanic activity was the true cause, as the K-Pg event occurred relatively early in a long period of eruption of the Deccan Traps range that initially produced huge amounts of climate-altering gases.</u></span> These dissenters note that other mass extinctions have coincided with large volcanic eruptions, while only the K-Pg event lines up with an asteroid strike.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes how Hull’s team would most likely respond to the argument in the underlined portion of Text 1, which asserts that volcanic activity in the Deccan Traps range led to changes in the climate and caused the K-Pg mass extinction event. According to Text 2, although Hull’s team found that activity in the Deccan Traps did indeed alter the climate before the K-Pg event, the team determined that the climate had returned to normal before mass extinctions began. This finding and the observation that the K-Pg extinctions closely align with the Chicxulub asteroid impact suggest that Hull’s team would likely dispute the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 and say that the climate changes caused by the Deccan Traps activity were not the main cause of the extinctions. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would disagree that the Deccan Traps activity caused the K-Pg event. Additionally, the claim in the underlined portion of Text 1 says nothing about how the Chicxulub impact changed the climate, so while Hull’s team might believe that the impact did in fact change the climate, they could not be said to agree with the claim in Text 1 on this point. Choice C is incorrect because there is no indication in either text that any scientists assume that the Chicxulub impact caused the Deccan Traps activity, so there is no reason to conclude that Hull’s team would question why the scientists referred to in Text 1 make such an assumption. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 describes how Hull’s team found that the climate had recovered from the changes brought about by the Deccan Traps activity before the K-Pg event occurred, which suggests that Hull’s team would say that the Deccan Traps activity had a less enduring effect on global conditions than the scientists referenced in Text 1 believe, not that the effect on global conditions was more significant than those scientists claim. </p>

          <p>In the early days of television in the 1940s, many people thought that US television programs would rely on the financial support of ad agencies and commercial sponsors, much like radio did.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it accurately describes the function of the underlined phrase in the text as a whole. According to the text, advertisers were reluctant to support television in its early days. The underlined phrase then indicates that this reluctance was partly due to the US’s involvement in World War II, which hindered television production. Thus, the underlined phrase identifies a specific reason behind some advertisers’ hesitance to support television.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text merely mentions that television was expected to be financed through advertising, as radio was at the time. Nothing in the text compares the origins of radio and television. Choice C is incorrect. The underlined phrase focuses on a reason advertisers were reluctant to support television, not measures taken to convince advertisers to support television. Choice D is incorrect. The underlined phrase focuses on a reason advertisers were reluctant to support television, not what types of television programming were popular.</p>

          <p>In most building demolitions, the building materials are destroyed and sent to landfills. City officials in Portland, Oregon, wanted to reduce this waste. The officials passed a law requiring demolition companies to deconstruct some buildings instead. Deconstruction involves carefully taking buildings apart piece by piece. Damage to the materials is avoided so that they can be reused in new constructions. A 2019 study found that 27 percent of materials from deconstructions in Portland were able to be reused. The remaining materials were processed for recycling instead of going to a landfill.</p>

The author first describes a Portland law aimed at reducing demolition waste, and then goes on to explain that 27% of materials from building deconstructions were able to be reused and the rest were recycled. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the popularity of the law. Choice C is incorrect. The text never compares building deconstruction to other measures designed to reduce demolition waste.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. “Suitable” means “appropriate for a particular purpose.” Since the text indicates that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage, we can infer that the author believes that ballet is a very suitable artform for telling Osage stories. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith’s choice was determined. That would imply that Tinker-Smith initially faced some kind of obstacle or opposition, and nothing like that is mentioned in the passage. Choice C is incorrect. The text implies the opposite of this. “Arbitrary” means “based on random choice or whim rather than reason.” But the text does give us a good reason behind the choice to tell Osage stories through ballet: two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage. Choice D is incorrect. The text never suggests that Tinker-Smith’s choice was “unpredictable.” Rather, the fact that two of the best ballet dancers of the twentieth century were Osage makes ballet especially appropriate for telling Osage stories. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Three Sisters intercropping system. As used in this context, “intricate” would mean made up of complexly related elements. The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a “web of relations” in which the crops interact in various ways. The text’s description of these interactions—the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use—provides context suggesting that this “web of relations” is intricate. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as “indecipherable,” or impossible to comprehend, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text’s description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not indecipherable. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the practical benefits that each plant in the Three Sisters system provides to other members of the system, showing that the relationship among the crops that make up the system is not “ornamental,” or mainly serving a decorative purpose. Choice C is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as “obscure,” or unknown or poorly understood, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text’s description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not obscure. </p>

<p>When the 50-second-long film <em>Arrival of the Train</em>—which depicts what its title says, a train pulling into a station—was first shown publicly in 1896, spectators, naïve to the new medium of film and seeing a train appearing to come directly at them, leaped from their seats and fled the room. This moment marks a major cultural shift: a new way of representing and seeing the world had arrived with that train, and nothing would ever be the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span aria-level="2" class="paired_passage" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>The fact that there is no contemporary evidence that the first audience of <em>Arrival of the Train</em> was alarmed has not stopped the story from becoming canonical, even among film historians. But that phenomenon itself is highly revealing. Our belief that the coming of film was transformative is so strong that we invented and keep retelling a founding myth that divides cultural history into a (naïve) “before” and (sophisticated) “after.” </p>
          <p>Based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement about the description of the first showing of <em>Arrival of the Train</em> in Text 1?</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it provides a statement about the description of the first showing of <em>Arrival of the Train</em> in Text 1 that, based on the texts, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with. Text 1 indicates that members of the audience, unaccustomed to the new medium of film and believing that they were looking at a real oncoming train, allegedly reacted to the film with alarm. Text 1 then goes on to treat this anecdote as a factual account of the film’s first showing, interpreting it as a moment that marked a "major cultural shift." In contrast, the author of Text 2 indicates that though the story of the film’s first showing has become "canonical," or widely accepted, there is no contemporary evidence to support the idea that the audience reacted as Text 1 describes. Text 2 goes on to explain that this factually questionable description likely persists because it functions as a "founding myth" that reinforces a widespread belief in the profoundly transformative nature of the invention of film. This indicates that the author of Text 2 would likely see the description in Text 1 as motivated primarily by cultural perceptions about film’s significance rather than by documented historical facts.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 doesn’t suggest that film historians regard the view about film’s transformative nature as naïve. On the contrary, Text 2 states that the story of the first showing of <em>Arrival of the Train</em> has become "canonical, even among film historians," indicating that historians broadly accept this narrative as a compelling illustration of film’s impact, not that they regard either the narrative or the views it conveys about the transformative nature of film as naïve. Text 2 refers to a "(naïve) ‘before’" in cultural history, but this is describing how the myth itself characterizes pre-film audiences, not how historians regard views about the transformative nature of film. Choice C is incorrect. While the author of Text 2 does indicate that the story of the audience’s reaction to <em>Arrival of the Train </em>described in Text 1 is a myth that lacks evidence, the text doesn’t suggest that the story reflects the fact that film historians believe themselves to be more sophisticated than modern audiences are. Rather, Text 2 suggests that the story persists because of a collective cultural belief, which historians share, in the profound impact of the invention of film. Moreover, the "naïve" versus "sophisticated" distinction mentioned in Text 2 refers to how the myth characterizes audiences before and after the invention of film; it doesn’t characterize modern audiences versus film historians. Choice D is incorrect. Although the author of Text 2 would agree that the description of the first showing of <em>Arrival of the Train</em> in Text 1 reflects a misconception, the author wouldn’t agree that widespread belief in the misconception can be attributed to the fact that it accurately captures early audiences’ actual sense of alarm. In fact, the misconception identified by the author of Text 2 concerns the accuracy of the audience’s alleged reaction; the author questions whether early audiences were alarmed at all, stating there is "no contemporary evidence" that they reacted in this way. According to Text 2, the description is widely believed not because it accurately captures historical reactions but because it serves as a "founding myth" that supports a belief in film’s transformative cultural impact.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano. The narrator reveals that she “had to act really happy” about the piano even though she “pretty much hated the thing” as soon as it was placed upstairs near her bedroom. The narrator also describes the piano as glaring at her and compares it to a caged bird that wants to be set free. These details establish the narrator’s feelings about the piano, suggesting that it makes her uneasy. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the narrator hated having the piano upstairs right next to her bedroom, not that she wanted a piano to be close to her bedroom. Choice C is incorrect because the only information provided in the text about the narrator’s brothers is that they were given the piano along with the narrator. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not describe the event that led the narrator’s parents to buy the piano from the people moving to Utah. Instead, the text focuses on the narrator’s feelings about the piano after it was given to her and her brothers. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the cover art of Virginia Woolf’s novels. In this context, “partnership” means collaboration or joint effort. The text states that Woolf’s sister Vanessa Bell was a talented painter and that Bell worked with Woolf to provide the cover art for most of Woolf’s novels. Thus, this context suggests that Woolf and Bell pursued a creative partnership in order to produce several of Woolf’s novels. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is no indication that Woolf or Bell were undergoing a “rebellion,” or revolt, against anything in particular. Instead, the text focuses on how they worked together in some aspects of the production of Woolf’s novels. Choice C is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that Woolf or Bell made a “discovery,” or encountered anything new for the first time as they worked together. The text suggests that Woolf had already written her novels and that Bell then assisted Woolf with the cover art for many of them. Choice D is incorrect because the text implies that Woolf and Bell had a positive relationship. According to the text, the sisters “worked closely” together to produce the cover art for many of Woolf’s novels; the text doesn’t mention whether while working together, Woolf and Bell had a “disagreement,” or conflict. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the art at the National Museum of the American Indian. In this context, "homogenous" means uniform or highly similar. The text explains that the painters whose works are included in this museum’s collection employ an array of artistic styles, both Native and non-Native, traditional and new. Given this high degree of stylistic diversity, it is a misconception that Native art is uniform, or homogenous.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t consider whether Native art is controversial, or causes disagreement or discussion; instead, the text discusses the stylistic diversity of the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some of the artists whose work is represented in the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian blend various artistic traditions into highly individual styles of their own, this is not the primary focus of the text. Instead, the text is concerned with how Native art is often mistakenly perceived as uniform, when in fact it is stylistically diverse. Choice C is incorrect because the text never implies that people mistakenly conceive of Native art as theoretical, or concerned with philosophical or abstract issues; instead, the text’s discussion of Native art is framed around this art’s stylistic diversity versus the misconception of it as homogenous.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “endure” most nearly means tolerate. In the text, Cecily and Algernon discuss parting, or saying goodbye. Cecily remarks on the deep pain of saying goodbye to people whom one has only known briefly and then comments on the equanimity, or calm steadiness, one experiences when separated from old friends. The text sets up an ironic contrast: one can easily tolerate, or put up with, the absence of close friends, but even a very short separation from a new acquaintance is unbearable. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Nothing in the text suggests that Cecily associates regret, or a feeling of sorrow, with the absence of old friends. Rather, the text sets up an ironic contrast between the feeling of calm steadiness one feels when separated from old friends and the unbearable pain of being separated from new acquaintances. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “endure” can mean persist, or proceed stubbornly, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because what is being endured is the absence of old friends. Whereas one can persist <em>despite</em> the absence of someone else, one can’t persist the absence itself. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t convey that Cecily encourages, or urges, old friends to be absent. Although it may be that Cecily prefers new acquaintances to friends she has known for a long time, the text focuses on her feelings as a result of others’ absences, not on her treatment of others. </p>

Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses the relative appeal of certain colors in paintings but gives no indication that any colors would ever be "corrected by" viewers, or somehow fixed or improved by them. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make much sense to say that some colors are more "similar to" viewers than others, which would suggest that colors and viewers are alike to different degrees. Further, the text primarily emphasizes a difference, not a similarity, in how appealing paintings tend to be based on the colors they contain.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft’s contact with the asteroid 101955 Bennu. In this context, “collected” means acquired and took away.

This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context “attached” means connected or affixed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid.

The text doesn’t suggest that the spacecraft tracked the sample, and it’s not clear what it would mean for the spacecraft to travel behind the sample it collected. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “replaced” means put back or returned. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth but doesn’t suggest that anything was returned to the asteroid. </p>

<p>For decades, bluegrass musicians have debated whether their genre should exclude influences from mainstream genres such as rock. Many insist that bluegrass is defined by its adherence to the folk music of the US South, out of which bluegrass emerged. Such “purists,” as they are known, regard the recordings of Bill Monroe, which established the bluegrass sound in the 1940s, as a standard against which the genre should still be measured.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span aria-level="2" role="heading">Text 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Bluegrass isn’t simply an extension of folk traditions into the era of recorded music. In reality, Bill Monroe created the bluegrass sound in the 1940s by combining Southern folk music with commercial genres that had arisen only a few decades before, such as jazz and the blues. Since bluegrass has always been a mixed genre, contemporary bluegrass musicians should not be forbidden from incorporating into it influences from rock and other mainstream genres.</p>
          <p>Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely regard the perspective of bluegrass purists, as described in Text 1?</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. According to Author 1, the “purists” argue that bluegrass should stick to its folk music roots. But Author 2 points out that this isn’t how bluegrass emerged: it actually got its sound from a mix of folk, jazz, and blues. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. There’s nothing in Text 2 about what other genres the purists enjoy, so this inference about Author 2’s views isn’t supported. Choice B is incorrect.

Researcher Kelly Bremner, however, has noted that Appia lacked technical expertise in the use of light in the theater. As a result of Appia’s inexperience, Bremner argues, Appia’s theory of light called for lighting practices that weren’t possible until after the advent of electricity around 1881. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>
<p>Adolphe Appia was not an amateur in the practice of lighting. Instead, it is precisely his exposure to lighting techniques at the time that contributed to his theory on the importance of light. When working as an apprentice for a lighting specialist in his youth, Appia observed the use of portable lighting devices that could be operated by hand. This experience developed his understanding of what was possible in the coordination of elements on the stage.</p>
          <p>Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim about Appia’s level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1?</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. The author of Text 2 directly contradicts Bremner’s claim that Appia lacked technical expertise by stating that Appia was “not an amateur in the practice of lighting.” His experience as a lighting specialist’s apprentice would have, the author of Text 2 argues, allowed Appia to “[develop] his understanding of what was possible” with the elements of theatrical design. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Neither text describes how other lighting technicians responded to Appia’s ideas. Furthermore, this claim isn’t relevant to Bremner’s evaluation of Appia’s technical expertise. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about the opinions of theater practitioners who worked with Appia, so this answer choice does not relate to the claim about Appia’s level of technical expertise made by Bremner in Text 1. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about Appia’s familiarity with or ignorance of the use of music and sound in theater. Both focus on his expertise (or lack thereof) in lighting. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of a relationship between the dodder plant and its host plant. As used in this context, “synchronization” means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant flower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before flowering. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because referring to “hibernation,” or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in—making use of a protein and producing flowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in “prediction,” or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about flowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular flowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to flower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to “moderation,” or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn’t suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant’s flowering activity; the two plants simply flower in unison. </p>

<p>Most scientists agree that the moon was likely formed after a collision between Earth and a large planet named Theia. This collision likely created a huge debris field, made up of material from both Earth and Theia. Based on models of this event, scientists believe that the moon was formed from this debris over the course of thousands of years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong> </p>
<p>Researchers from NASA’s Ames Research Center used a computer to model how the moon could have formed. Although simulations of the moon’s formation have been done in the past, the team from NASA ran simulations that were much more detailed. They found that the formation of the moon was likely not a slow process that took many years. Instead, it’s probable that the moon’s formation happened immediately after impact, taking just a few hours.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text "reaching across to" most nearly means stretching toward. The text begins with Mrs. Wilkins stating that she wants to have one of the oranges that she’s admiring. The text then indicates that Mrs. Wilkins, staying where she is, holds out a big orange to her friend. This context suggests that when the text describes Mrs. Wilkins as reaching across to the bowl of oranges, it means that she is stretching toward the bowl.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is joining with, or becoming attached to, the bowl of oranges. Rather, the text indicates that she is stretching toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that Mrs. Wilkins is gaining on, or overtaking in a competition or race, the bowl of oranges. The text suggests instead that the bowl is sitting still on a surface and that Mrs. Wilkins is extending her arm toward the bowl so she can pick out oranges for herself and her friend Rose to eat. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Mrs. Wilkins is arriving at the bowl of oranges. In fact, the text states that Mrs. Wilkins stays where she is when reaching across to the bowl, meaning that she remains at a distance from it.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The text begins with a question: have penguins always been unable to fly? The underlined sentence then presents an answer that has been offered by researchers, indicating that Theresa Cole and her team believe that penguins were once able to fly but lost that ability long ago as they began living in the sea. The text then describes the research that led to that answer. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to provide an answer to the question in the previous sentence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because none of the terms used in the sentence that follows are defined in the underlined sentence; no definitions are given at all. Instead, the sentence presents Theresa Cole and her team’s answer to the earlier question about penguins’ ability to fly. Choice B is incorrect because there is no contradiction between the underlined sentence and the sentence that follows since both convey that at some point penguins underwent adaptations that limited their ability to fly and helped them swim and live in the sea. Instead of contradicting later information, the underlined sentence presents an answer to the earlier question about penguins’ ability to fly. Choice D is incorrect because the question in the previous sentence is about penguins’ ability to fly and the underlined sentence presents Theresa Cole and her team’s answer to that question based on their research into penguin flight, which is described in the rest of the text.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A. In this context, "an oddity" is something that is odd or unusual. The text explains that the burst lasted for 200 seconds and that other bursts generated by neutron mergers have usually lasted fewer than 2 seconds. In other words, the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A was unusual.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a difference between the duration of gamma ray burst GRB 230307A and the typical duration of bursts caused by neutron mergers, not "a coincidence," or a point of correspondence, between them; the text indicates that GRB 230307A lasted much longer than what is typical of other bursts. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "a reprieve" would be either a temporary relief from something or a delay of a punishment, neither of which would make sense as something that the duration of a gamma ray burst could provide to the burst itself. Choice C is incorrect. Although it would make sense to refer to gamma ray burst GRB 230307A itself as "an incident," or a thing that occurred, the missing word describes the duration of the burst, and it doesn’t make much sense to describe a length of time as an incident. Further, the sentence emphasizes that the burst’s duration was very unusual, not simply that the burst occurred.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the contributions of the Sumerian civilization. In this context, “introduced” means brought into practice or use. The text states that the first reference to a seven-day week appears in the Sumerian <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em>. The text presents this information about the seven-day week as an example of a concept introduced by the Sumerian civilization that persists into present-day civilizations. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the Sumerian civilization “transformed,” or changed the nature of, concepts that persist into present-day civilizations. Instead, the text’s presentation of a Sumerian literary work that contains the first description of the seven-day week is an example of the phenomenon described in the first half of the sentence, suggesting that the Sumerians invented many concepts that still persist. Choice C is incorrect because the information that a Sumerian literary work includes the first description of the seven-day week suggests that Sumerian civilization may have originated the seven-day week and other concepts that persist into present-day civilizations, not that it “inherited” the concepts, or received them from an ancestral figure or culture. Choice D is incorrect because the information that Sumerian civilization produced the first description of the seven-day week is presented as an example of the phenomenon described in the first half of the sentence, suggesting that Sumerian civilization originated this and other concepts that still persist, not that the Sumerians “overlooked,” or failed to notice or consider, such concepts. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of physicist Joseph Webster’s research on gravitational waves. In this context “foundational” means the basis on which something else develops. The text indicates that Webster’s experiments in the 1960s and 1970s were earlier than, and “key” to, the work of later scientists in the field; thus, Webster’s work was foundational to the later scientists’ experiments and the eventual detection of a gravitational wave in 2015.  </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Webster’s work was supplementary, or an additional element of an existing, larger project, but rather it was “the basis for” later experiments. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not assert that Webster’s work was repetitive, or involved doing something the same way many times. Rather, the text indicates that Webster’s work formed the basis for later investigations in the field of gravitational wave research.  Choice D is incorrect because the text does not state that Webster’s work was ineffective, or failed to produce the desired outcome. Rather, the text strongly implies that Webster’s work was productive and extremely important to later work in the field of gravitational wave research. </p>

          <p>According to Indian economist and sociologist Radhakamal Mukerjee (1889–1968), the Eurocentric concepts that informed early twentieth-century social scientific methods—for example, the idea that all social relations are reducible to struggles between individuals—had little relevance for India. Making the social sciences more responsive to Indians’ needs, Mukerjee argued, required constructing analytical categories informed by India’s cultural and ecological circumstances. Mukerjee thus proposed the communalist “Indian village” as the ideal model on which to base Indian economic and social policy.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The narrator asserts that she loves both her “own” country (Japan) and her “adopted country” (the United States) even though the two countries differ “widely.” She also indicates that, at first, she would try to explain unfamiliar experiences that she had in the United States using the standards ingrained in her from growing up in Japan. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to convey the narrator’s experience of observing and making sense of the differences between two cultures she embraces. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text makes no reference to possible companions. Although the text does indicate that the narrator sometimes used the cultural framework she acquired growing up in Japan to explain some experiences she’s had, there is no suggestion that this was in service of making friends. And although “no one seemed to know” strongly implies that the narrator has interacted with other people in the United States, there is no indication that these conversations involved her discussing Japanese customs. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the narrator was hesitant to ask questions. In fact, the narrator indicates that “no one seemed to know the origin” of various customs, which provides evidence that, rather than being hesitant, she sought information from several people. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no reference to the physical distance between Japan and the United States. Although the narrator indicates that the two countries differ “widely” and likens them to “two separate worlds,” these descriptions relate to cultural aspects of the countries and the narrator’s feelings about the two countries, not the physical distance between them. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fork fern’s enormous genome. In this context, "superseded" means surpassed or exceeded by something else. The text establishes that this plant has "the largest known" genome among eukaryotes and mentions "the high biological costs of extremely large genomes," suggesting there are natural constraints that make it biologically disadvantageous to maintain such massive genetic material. This context supports the idea that it’s unlikely another organism will evolve an even larger genome that would replace this plant’s record—that is, its status as having the largest genome is unlikely to be superseded.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "protracted" would mean drawn out over time or space, and the text focuses on the record size of the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry "high biological costs." This information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it’s unlikely to be protracted. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "curtailed" would mean cut short or reduced, and the text focuses on the record size of the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry "high biological costs." This information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it’s unlikely to be curtailed. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "obviated" would mean made unnecessary or redundant, and the text focuses on the record size of the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome and the fact that extremely large genomes carry "high biological costs." This information suggests that the biological upper limit for genome size may have been reached and that the New Caledonian fork fern’s genome is therefore unlikely to be surpassed, or superseded, not that it’s unlikely to be obviated.</p>

          <p>In the <em>Here and Now Storybook</em> (1921), educator Lucy Sprague Mitchell advanced the then controversial idea that books for very young children should imitate how they use language, since toddlers, who cannot yet grasp narrative or abstract ideas, seek reassurance in verbal repetition and naming. The most enduring example of this idea is Margaret Wise Brown’s 1947 picture book <em>Goodnight Moon</em>, in which a young rabbit names the objects in his room as he drifts off to sleep.

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Helen Liu Fong’s architectural designs. In this context, “traditional” means conventional. The text states that rather than use “standard shapes and colors,” Fong pursued “innovative” and “daring” design choices in her work. Fong’s style is depicted as inventive, so it therefore makes sense in this context that she avoided mainstream, traditional designs in her buildings. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong’s work is innovative and experimental. Thus, Fong’s design choices could reasonably be considered creative, or original. She likely would have pursued creative designs, not avoided them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Fong used “daring” hues in her designs. Thus, Fong likely would have pursued bold, or brave and vivid design choices; she wouldn’t have avoided them. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t address whether Fong’s designs are understandable, or reasonable or expected. The text focuses on certain characteristics of Fong’s designs, not on how people received or understood them. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text. The text first states that animals make use of objects as tools to help them achieve different goals. The text then explains that although people used to think only primates use tools, tool use by dolphins (aquatic mammals) and palm cockatoos (birds) has shown that primates are not the only animals that use tools. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to argue that a variety of animals, not just primates, use tools.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention intelligence at all, focusing just on the idea that animals use tools. Further, the text mentions one kind of bird (palm cockatoos) only as an example of a non-primate that uses tools and describes its use of tools as creative, not unintelligent. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions tool use in primates (a group that includes humans) and in palm cockatoos, it doesn’t compare humans’ tool use with palm cockatoos’ tool use. The text mentions palm cockatoos only as one example out of the variety of animals that use tools and never directly mentions tool use in humans. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses tool use but never makes any mention of intelligence. Rather than establishing that tool use doesn’t indicate intelligence, the text describes certain tool use as inventive and creative.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the sentence about the influences on Banisadr’s work. In context, “It is by no means” followed by “unimportant” conveys how it is relevant to recognize Bosch’s influence on Banisadr. The text points out that the artist himself cites Bosch as an inspiration, and then goes on to claim that <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> has had a more significant influence than Bosch. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “substantial,” which means weighty or meaningful, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be meaningful to acknowledge Bosch’s influence on Banisadr. The phrase “indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration” doesn’t support this suggestion. Choice B is incorrect because “satisfying,” which means pleasing, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be pleasing to acknowledge Bosch’s influence on Banisadr. The phrase “indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration” doesn’t support this suggestion. Choice D is incorrect because “appropriate,” which means suitable, incorrectly suggests that it wouldn’t be proper to acknowledge Bosch’s influence on Banisadr. The phrase “indeed, Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an inspiration” doesn’t support this suggestion. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of a prediction about a kilonova. In this context, a "theory" is an explanation that is considered scientifically acceptable. The text states that astronomers predicted in the 1990s that a collision between a black hole and a neutron star or between two neutron stars could release a massive gamma ray burst called a kilonova, explaining that they determined this possibility based on their extensive work with existing data and simulations ("calculations and models"). In other words, the prediction was a theory—a well-supported explanation—that, as the text indicates, was later confirmed with observations in 2017.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and a prediction of an event isn’t "evidence," or proof, of that event’s existence, even when the prediction is based on extensive study. Further, there would be no need for later confirmation of something that was already recognized as evidence. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, a "constant" is a situation or factor that doesn’t change. The text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and there is no reason to describe the prediction as a constant because the text doesn’t suggest that the prediction was completely unchanged over time—it addresses only the making of the prediction and its later confirmation. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017; although a prediction might be informed by an "experiment," or a controlled test, a prediction is an idea rather than a test.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text’s overall portrayal of how the women in Ohiyesa’s tribe harvested maple syrup. The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple trees in order to find out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap described as the trees’ “life-blood.” Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so. Using personification, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees—their potential to give sap—that the women are evaluating. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence does mention “individual characters,” this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees, which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence focuses on the trees’ willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the beneficial relationship between the women and the trees. Additionally, although the text does suggest that the women and their tribe benefit from the maple trees since the trees allow the women to harvest syrup, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the trees benefit from this relationship in turn. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence is comparing maple trees to humans, not addressing the influence of the natural environment on how the actual humans in the text, the women, behave. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing "similarities with" means having some resemblance to. The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren’t closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are "examples of," or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states that despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren’t closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can’t be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "concerns about" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There’s nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "indications of" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn’t be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups.</p>

          <p><strong><span aria-level="2" role="heading">Text 1</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2021, a team led by Amir Siraj hypothesized that the Chicxulub impactor—the object that struck the Yucatán Peninsula sixty-six million years ago, precipitating the mass extinction of the dinosaurs—was likely a member of the class of long-period comets. As evidence, Siraj cited the carbonaceous chondritic composition of samples from the Chicxulub impact crater as well as of samples obtained from long-period comet Wild 2 in 2006.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span aria-level="2" role="heading">Text 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Although long-period comets contain carbonaceous chondrites, asteroids are similarly rich in these materials. Furthermore, some asteroids are rich in iridium, as Natalia Artemieva points out, whereas long-period comets are not. Given the prevalence of iridium at the crater and, more broadly, in geological layers deposited worldwide following the impact, Artemieva argues that an asteroid is a more plausible candidate for the Chicxulub impactor.</p>
          <p>Based on the texts, how would Artemieva likely respond to Siraj’s hypothesis, as presented in Text 1?</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. Siraj’s hypothesis is that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-period comet. But Artemieva points to the iridium found in the crater and in “geological layers that were deposited worldwide after the impact” as evidence that it was actually an asteroid, not a long-period comet. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. Text 2 never discusses whether Wild 2 is representative of long-period comets in general. Rather, Text 2 presents Artemieva’s argument that the Chicxulub impactor was an asteroid, not a long-term comet. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. Siraj’s hypothesis doesn’t make this connection: rather, Siraj hypothesizes that the Chicxulub impactor was a long-term comet. Choice D is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how Artemieva would respond to Siraj’s hypothesis. “Soil samples from sites distant from the Chicxulub crater” is too vague. Only soil samples from sites that are connected to the impact in some way are involved in either hypothesis. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of artworks that were produced for exhibition on the internet. In this context, "defunct" means no longer existing or functioning. According to the text, many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible due to their reliance on certain software. As an example, the text cites Sinae Kim’s <em>Genesis</em>, which relied on software that was discontinued in 2021. This context supports the idea that the software is defunct.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that viewing artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet requires the use of software. Artists generally want their works to be seen by many people, so it wouldn’t make sense for creators of internet art to require the use of software that is "arcane," or known or knowable to only a few people. Moreover, the text states that a prominent example of software used to view these artworks is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it’s now defunct. Choice C is incorrect because "ubiquitous" would mean found everywhere, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text indicates that the reason why many artworks that were produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet have become inaccessible has to do with the software required for viewing them. According to the text, one example of such software is Adobe Flash, which was discontinued in 2021, meaning it’s now defunct. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the software used to view artworks produced in the mid-1990s to the early 2000s for exhibition on the internet is "extraneous," or irrelevant. Instead, the text indicates that use of specific software is required to view certain artworks from this period and that the discontinuation of the software renders the works inaccessible.</p>

<p>One challenge faced by researchers studying global urbanization is that countries may define urban settlements differently. Many countries define urban settlements based on the number of people living in them. However, countries do not all use the same number; for example, Iceland uses a minimum population of 200, while the Netherlands uses 20,000. Other countries use a combination of population and other factors. This variation makes it difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span aria-level="2" class="paired_passage" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Recently, a group of six international organizations developed global definitions of common types of settlements. The group developed a new measure called the “degree of urbanization.” This new measure establishes global criteria used to define three types of settlements (cities, towns, and rural areas) and allows researchers to better understand global urbanization rates. </p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because Text 2 presents a possible solution to the problem identified in Text 1—that is, how disparities in the criteria used by different countries to define urban settlements make it "difficult for researchers to compare aspects of urbanization in different countries." Text 2 describes the creation of a shared framework for studying global urbanization: "global definitions of common types of settlements" and a "new measure called the ‘degree of urbanization’" that "allows researchers to better understand global urbanization rates."</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although Text 2 mentions "a group of six international organizations" that developed criteria and a measure related to settlements and urbanization, no organization or institution is singled out to perform further research. Choice B is incorrect because both texts are about urbanization research and neither mentions any other fields of study. Choice C is incorrect. Text 2 discusses a possible solution to the terminological problem in global urbanization research, not additional areas of difficulty in the field.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the Kelmscott Press’s books. In this context, "manifest in" means evident or apparent from. The text states that the Kelmscott Press, which was cofounded by William Morris, produced its books using preindustrial methods. The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is "insensible to," or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris’s repudiation of industrialization. Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense to say that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization was "scrutinized by," or examined closely by, the Kelmscott editions’ use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation. Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris’s work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris’s attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris’s repudiation of industrialization is "complicated by," or made more complex or difficult by, the Kelmscott Press’s use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books. Instead, the text presents those methods as exemplifying Morris’s repudiation of industrialization.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the difficulty in naming a large number of minor planets. In this context, "insurmountable" means impossible to overcome or too difficult to solve. The text establishes that coming up with distinct names for minor planets is already a difficult task that has become even more challenging because there are now more than 500,000 known minor planets. The logical conclusion is that finding unique names for such a vast number of celestial objects has become virtually impossible—or insurmountable—which explains why the majority of recently discovered minor planets receive only identification numbers instead of proper names.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "feasible" means possible to do or achieve, which would contradict the logic of the text. The text indicates that the task of naming minor planets has become more difficult because of their large number. The text then explains that this is why most new discoveries receive only identification numbers. If the task were feasible, there would be no reason to abandon the practice of giving proper names to minor planets in favor of using only numbers. Choice C is incorrect because "substantial" means considerable in size, amount, or importance. While the text does suggest that naming all minor planets would be a significant undertaking, describing the task as substantial wouldn’t logically explain why the naming practice has been largely abandoned in favor of using only identification numbers. The text suggests that the task has become virtually impossible (insurmountable), not merely large or significant. Choice D is incorrect because "unnecessary," which means not needed, would suggest that giving proper names to minor planets serves no purpose. However, the text doesn’t question the value or purpose of naming minor planets; rather, it explains that the sheer number of discoveries has made the already challenging naming task nearly impossible to complete. The text provides an example of a named minor planet (1227 Geranium), indicating that naming has been considered worthwhile but has become impractical because of the volume.</p>

<p>French Impressionist artist Edgar Degas insisted that his paintings be kept in their original frames after they were sold. Like many Impressionist painters, Degas used painted frames that stood in contrast to the gold frames frequently seen at the Paris Salon, a prestigious art exhibition that was sponsored by the French government and promoted traditional painting styles. Impressionist painters likely chose these colorful frames to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time.</p>

<p>Impressionist painters often focused on the interplay of color and light in their works. As such, those Impressionists who placed their works in painted frames instead of the more traditional gold ones did so for aesthetic reasons: a frame’s color was likely chosen because it would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting. Gold, conversely, could distract from the subtleties in a painted scene. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it presents the statement about the use of painted frames in Impressionist painting that both authors would be most likely to agree with. Text 1 discusses painter Edgar Degas’s insistence that his works remain in their original painted frames, which contrasted with the gold frames that were typical of the Paris art scene at the time. The text then argues that the preference of Degas and other French Impressionist painters for colorful frames can likely be attributed to their desire "to distinguish themselves from what was considered conventional at the time." Text 2 also notes that Impressionist painters "placed their works in painted frames" but argues that they probably did so for a purely aesthetic reason: to ensure that "the frame’s color...would harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting." Though differing on Impressionist painters’ rationale for using painted frames, the authors of both texts would agree that many Impressionist painters were intentional about the frames they selected for their works.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because neither text suggests that gold frames were considered desirable by those purchasing Impressionist works. Indeed, it can be inferred from the fact that Impressionist painters used painted frames that those who purchased those works wouldn’t have had a strong preference for gold frames. Choice B is incorrect because neither text suggests that Impressionist painters chose colors for their paintings based on planned frame colors. Indeed, Text 2 states that frame colors were chosen to "harmonize with the colors or subjects in a painting," implying that the color scheme of paintings predated and took precedence over the choice of the colors of frames. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 presents Degas’s preference for painted frames as being typical of Impressionist painters’ attitudes toward the framing of their works. Moreover, although Text 2 doesn’t specifically discuss Degas, it concurs with Text 1’s assertion that these painters preferred painted frames. Thus, both texts position painted frames as a hallmark of French Impressionist painting, not as a deviation from it.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "arranged" most nearly means "organized." The text states that a welcome feature of Manchester’s art galleries (as opposed to others) is that the titles of the paintings are easy to see and that a catalogue is therefore unneeded while visitors browse the art galleries. This suggests that the paintings are displayed in a systematic, or organized, way.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. "Ranked" might mean either classified or placed in orderly rows. Neither of these meanings would necessarily imply that the names of the paintings are easy to see (even if the paintings are placed in rows, their labels might be obscured). Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to describe the paintings as "scheduled," or planned to take place at a certain time. Choice D is incorrect because if the paintings were "discussed," or talked about, this would have no bearing on whether the names of the paintings could be easily seen.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of gender roles in Shakespeare’s comedies. As used in this context, “prescribed” would mean laid down as rules. The text indicates that the characters in the comedies often defy gender roles that are “socially dictated” (even if most characters do return to those roles eventually) and that scholars have been very interested in these acts of defiance. This context indicates that what the characters are rebelling against are standards of behavior prescribed by the society of the time.  </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because saying that expectations about gender were “interjected,” or suddenly inserted between other things, wouldn’t make sense in context. There’s no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender roles was inserted between other things or was an interruption in a larger discussion. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not expectations that society has “committed,” or carried out, entrusted, or promised. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been “socially dictated,” not expectations that have been “illustrated,” or clarified with examples. Although it’s possible for expectations about gender roles to be illustrated, there’s nothing in the text to indicate that characters in Shakespeare’s comedies rebel against illustrations of gender expectations. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Hegel’s works. In this context, "opaque" means difficult to understand or unclear. The text creates a contrast between the initial impression given by Hegel’s works and their influence and insight, noting that readers must "penetrate Hegel’s frustratingly dense prose" to access his important ideas. This context clearly establishes that Hegel’s writing is initially challenging to comprehend, or opaque.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "authoritative" means influential or clearly accurate. Hegel’s works may be authoritative, but it wouldn’t make logical sense in context to say that although his works seem authoritative, they have been influential. Instead, the text focuses on the fact that Hegel’s works are challenging to read, but that working through the dense prose can be rewarding. Choice C is incorrect because referring to Hegel’s works as "empirical," which means factual or verifiable, would suggest that they are based on observation or experience rather than theory. The text, however, doesn’t address this aspect of Hegel’s philosophy. Instead, it focuses on the difficulty of understanding his writing. Choice D is incorrect because describing Hegel’s works as "facile," which means superficial or simplistic, would directly contradict the text’s characterization of his writing as "frustratingly dense" and requiring effort to understand.</p>

<p>Philosopher G.E. Moore’s most influential work entails the concept of common sense. He asserts that there are certain beliefs that all people, including philosophers, know instinctively to be true, whether or not they profess otherwise: among them, that they have bodies, or that they exist in a world with other objects that have three dimensions. Moore’s careful work on common sense may seem obvious but was in fact groundbreaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span aria-level="2" role="heading">Text 2</span></strong></p>
<p>External world skepticism is a philosophical stance supposing that we cannot be sure of the existence of anything outside our own minds. During a lecture, G.E. Moore once offered a proof refuting this stance by holding out his hands and saying, “Here is one hand, and here is another.” Many philosophers reflexively reject this proof (Annalisa Coliva called it “an obviously annoying failure”) but have found it a challenge to articulate exactly why the proof fails.</p>

According to the author of Text 1, Moore’s definition of common sense—things we instinctively know are true—includes the belief that we all “exist in a world with other objects.” The author of Text 1 describes this notion as both “obvious” and “groundbreaking.”  So it’s safe to infer that the author would observe that Moore would respond to external world skeptics by arguing that since everyone instinctively knows that things exist outside of their own minds, then external world skepticism must be wrong. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. If anything, the author of Text 1 seems to agree with Moore. Choice B is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. The author of Text 1 never mentions external world skeptics directly, let alone why they have a hard time refuting Moore’s position. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to external world skeptics. Text 1’s presentation of Moore’s concept of common sense only includes the idea that some facts are true based on instinct—it doesn’t mention the idea that some proofs are inadequate based on instinct. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the <em>Sueño de Familia</em> art exhibition. In this context, “spans” means extends across or covers. The text states that the exhibition explores González’s artistic heritage and features artwork by her great-grandfather, grandmother, mother, and niece. This context conveys the idea that the exhibition spans, or extends across, five generations of González’s family. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the exhibition “borrows,” or acquires, five generations of González’s family. The text indicates that the exhibition features artwork by family members from five generations, not that the five generations themselves have been acquired for inclusion in the exhibition. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the purpose of the exhibition is to highlight artwork, not to “judge,” or give an opinion on, five generations of the artist’s family. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the exhibition “neglects,” or gives little attention to, five generations of González’s family. On the contrary, the text indicates that the exhibition is dedicated to exploring González’s artistic heritage and therefore designed to bring attention to her family members and their artwork. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text presents the speaker’s experience of viewing the sea. In the underlined portion, the speaker focuses on the idea that the waves hitting rocks on the shore are a relentless and enduring force: they are constantly pushed back (“ever repulsed”) but always return (“ever rushing on”), as though they have an energy that can’t be overcome (“a life that will not know defeat”). </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the underlined portion characterizes the waves as a relentless force (always “repulsed” but still “rushing on” and never being defeated), the speaker doesn’t suggest that the surroundings are intimidating. Instead, the speaker presents the scene in a positive way, describing the “deep delight” of the “gladsome,” or cheerful, waves and feeling “the heart / Leap joyous” while viewing the sea. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t suggest that the speaker is ambivalent, or has mixed feelings about, the natural world. Instead, it presents a single view of one part of the immediate surroundings: the speaker characterizes the sea’s waves as an unstoppable force, since they are constantly pushed back but always return (“ever repulsed, yet ever rushing on”). Choice D is incorrect. Although the text later suggests the speaker’s view of her own thoughts by referring to a “clouded brain” and a heart that leaps joyously, this reference neither occurs within the underlined portion nor establishes a clear contrast with the relentless determination of the waves. The underlined portion addresses only the speaker’s view of the waves and doesn’t suggest what her own thoughts might be. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. "Speculate" means "to form a theory or guess without any clear evidence." This makes sense because, due to the lack of "clear evidence," the archaeologists can only guess how the <em>pessoi</em> set might have come to be there.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. "Dismiss" can mean "send away" or "treat as unworthy of consideration." The text implies that the archaeologists are trying to figure out the truth—they wouldn’t "dismiss" what really happened. Choice C is incorrect. "Expand on" means "give more details about," but there aren’t any details to give. Without any "clear evidence," the archaeologists can’t give any more details. Choice D is incorrect. "Catalog" means "carefully record" or "make a list of." However, there’s no "clear evidence," so there’s no real information to "catalog."</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the role of the general store in US rural communities during the 1800s. In this context, "source" means a place where something originates or is obtained. The text states that people would share news while socializing at the general store. This context supports the idea that the store served as a source of information in rural communities.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "rival" would mean competitor or opponent. The text doesn’t indicate that the general store was a rival of anything. Instead, the text describes the general store as a place that enabled the sharing of information within rural communities. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "condition" would mean state, circumstance, or requirement.  Although the text implies that visiting the store was helpful for acquiring information since people shared news there, it wouldn’t make sense to say that the general store was a condition of information. Choice D is incorrect because "waste" would mean something that is unused, discarded, or spent unnecessarily, which would not make sense in context. The text describes the general store as an essential part of daily life and a place for socializing and information sharing. The store was therefore a source, not a waste, of information.</p>

<p>Like the work of Ralph Ellison before her, Toni Morrison’s novels feature scenes in which characters deliver sermons of such length and verbal dexterity that for a time, the text exchanges the formal parameters of fiction for those of oral literature. Given the many other echoes of Ellison in Morrison’s novels, both in structure and prose style, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">these scenes suggest Ellison’s direct influence on Morrison.</span></p>
<p>Text 2</p>
<p>In their destabilizing effect on literary form, the sermons in Morrison’s works recall those in Ellison’s. Yet literature by Black Americans abounds in moments where interpolated speech erodes the division between oral and written forms that literature in English has traditionally observed.

        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 2 argues that Morrison’s use of the sermon is not only influenced by Ellison, but also by a “community-wide strategy of resistance” to literary conventions practiced by Black American authors. Ellison, Text 2 alleges, is only one of many influences on Morrison. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Neither text specifically mentions sermons in works by authors other than Morrison or Ellison, only a tendency towards eroding “the division between oral and written forms” among Black American writers. Choice C is incorrect. Both texts describe similarities between the works of Ellison and Morrison, and neither points out instances of divergence. Text 2 simply suggests that Morrison was influenced by more than just Ellison. Choice D is incorrect. While Text 2 does discuss Morrison’s resistance to certain literary conventions, it’s unclear what it would mean for the underlined claim to be “indebted” to that tradition. This choice recycles language from the text, but not in a way that makes any coherent point. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of traffic signals. As used in this context, “featured” means had as a characteristic or part. The text indicates that although US traffic signals have lights of three different colors (red, yellow, and green), this wasn’t the case until the 1920s, when the three-light signal was first developed. Before then, the text suggests, traffic signals had fewer lights (as indicated by the word “only” in the second sentence). This context supports the idea that before the 1920s, traffic signals featured only red and green lights. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “avoided” means kept away from someone or something or prevented something from occurring, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss keeping away from someone or something but instead focuses on what US traffic signals look like. The text states that they didn’t have lights of three different colors until the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Choice C is incorrect because “appreciated” means admired or increased in value, neither of which would make sense in context. The text focuses solely on the fact that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. The text doesn’t mention how this characteristic or traffic signals in general are perceived or what their value is. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes “traffic signals,” which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to admire or increase the value of something. Choice D is incorrect because “disregarded” means ignored or treated something as unworthy of notice, neither of which would make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss how people react to traffic signals; rather, it addresses the idea that US traffic signals have contained lights of three colors only since the three-light signal was developed in the 1920s. Moreover, the blank portion of the text describes “traffic signals,” which are lifeless objects and therefore unable to ignore or treat something in a particular manner. </p>

The text begins with the narrator stating that Julius was very helpful to him and his wife when they moved to their new residence. The narrator then provides a list of examples to illustrate Julius’s helpfulness. For instance, the narrator states that Julius was familiar with the neighborhood’s roads, which suggests that he was helpful in navigating them, and that Julius helped manage the horses and dogs. The text’s many examples of Julius’s usefulness reinforce just how helpful he was and in how many different ways. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray either the narrator’s or his wife’s reaction to their new home. Rather, the text focuses on how Julius was useful to the narrator and his wife in their new home. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that Julius was knowledgeable about the soil, this is one of several supporting details that illustrate how helpful Julius was. Moreover, the text merely states that Julius was knowledgeable about soil; it doesn’t provide an example of that knowledge. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest the frequency with which the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together. In fact, it’s unclear from the text whether the narrator and Julius hunted and fished together at all. The text merely indicates that Julius knew the best places to hunt and fish—a detail that supports the text’s main purpose by conveying Julius’s usefulness. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text. The underlined portion ("which made me sad because that was the only thing Mago had envied me for") directly expresses Grande’s unhappiness about her sister’s diminished interest in her Barbie doll. The underlined text specifically identifies that Grande feels sad and explains why Mago’s disinterest particularly affects her—because it was the one rare instance where her older sister had envied her, rather than the reverse.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion expresses sadness, not anger. Although there is some correspondence between the emotions anger and envy and the text does indicate that Grande usually envies her sister, the underlined portion states that Grande feels sad about Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s Barbie, not angry about Mago’s refusal to spend time with her. Choice C is incorrect. While the first part of the sentence that contains the underlined portion indicates that Mago has previously taken an interest in Grande’s Barbie, implying that the sisters may regularly have played with the Barbie together in the past, the underlined portion doesn’t provide an example of this. The underlined portion instead explains why Mago’s recently developed disinterest in the Barbie saddens Grande. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole explains why Mago is unwilling to play with Grande. Rather than addressing Mago’s motivation or reasoning, the underlined portion describes Grande’s emotional reaction to Mago’s disinterest in Grande’s Barbie and explains why this lack of interest matters to Grande.</p>

          <p><span aria-level="2" role="heading"><strong>Text 1</strong></span></p>
<p>Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel <em>Orlando </em>is an oddity within her body of work. Her other major novels consist mainly of scenes of everyday life and describe their characters’ interior states in great detail, whereas <em>Orlando </em>propels itself through a series of fantastical events and considers its characters’ psychology more superficially. Woolf herself sometimes regarded the novel as a minor work, even admitting once that she “began it as a joke.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span aria-level="2" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Like Woolf’s other great novels, <em>Orlando </em>portrays how people’s memories inform their experience of the present. Like those works, it examines how people navigate social interactions shaped by gender and social class. Though it is lighter in tone—more entertaining, even—this literary “joke” nonetheless engages seriously with the themes that motivated the four or five other novels by Woolf that have achieved the status of literary classics.</p>
          <p>Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the assessment of <em>Orlando </em>presented in Text 1?</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the assessment of <em>Orlando </em>in Text 1. Both authors agree that <em>Orlando </em>is unusual for Woolf: Text 1 states that the novel examines its characters’ psychologies more superficially than Woolf’s other novels do, and Text 2 describes it as being lighter in tone. However, while Text 1 calls <em>Orlando </em>an “oddity” and mentions that Woolf “began it as a joke,” Text 2 asserts that <em>Orlando </em>engages the same themes as Woolf’s other great novels. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely accept that <em>Orlando </em>differs from Woolf’s other novels but would also insist on its importance in the context of Woolf’s work as a writer. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Text 2 does suggest that the humor in <em>Orlando </em>is effective. However, there’s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author would agree that Woolf’s talents were best suited to serious novels. Rather, the author of Text 2 compares <em>Orlando </em>favorably to other novels by Woolf that are implied to be darker in tone. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 does not indicate that <em>Orlando </em>is less impressive than Woolf’s other novels, but instead points out that it engages the same themes as other novels by Woolf that are considered classics. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in Text 1 or Text 2 to suggest that readers have generally ignored <em>Orlando </em>because of its reputation. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s description of efforts to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems. As used in this context, describing an explanation as “a straightforward” one would mean that the explanation is direct and uncomplicated. The text asserts that since it should be “nearly impossible” for planets to form in binary star systems, it’s “not surprising” that there isn’t a straightforward explanation for the existence of planets in such systems; the fact that one potential approach involves “complex” factors offers further contextual support for this idea. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that there isn’t “a discernible” explanation—meaning an explanation capable of being perceived—for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text discusses just such an explanation offered by Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be discerned. Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how difficult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems, suggesting that the situation isn’t marked by the lack of “an inconclusive” explanation—an explanation that does not resolve the issue—but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they’ve likely been inconclusive ones. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of “an unbiased,” or impartial and unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text indicates that it’s difficult to explain the existence of planets in such systems and it describes one attempt to do so, but there is no evidence that explanations from Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee or others are biased. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of US forest land classifications. In this context, "consensus" means agreement. The text indicates that a percentage given in a US forest land report differs from other estimates and that this discrepancy isn’t surprising, given that forest researchers regularly dispute one another’s classifications of parts of US forest land as either mature or old growth. This context conveys that there is little agreement when it comes to these categories.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text states that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth, which directly indicates that when it comes to these categories, there is much "deliberation," or discussion and consideration, not little deliberation. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn’t imply that there is little "vigilance," or careful attention, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers do pay attention to forest land classifications and question one another’s decisions. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that there is often dispute among forest researchers about classifications of US forest land as either mature or old growth; this doesn’t imply that there is little "interest," or concern, among researchers when it comes to these categories but rather conveys that researchers are concerned with forest land classifications and pay attention to one another’s classifications.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the purpose of the National Heritage Fellowship. In this context, "recognize" means acknowledge or honor someone officially for their achievements. The text states that the fellowship was created for "exceptional folk and traditional artists." It then provides an example of one recipient of the fellowship, circus aerialist Dolly Jacobs, who was given the fellowship "to celebrate her lifetime contributions to the arts." The fact that the fellowship is given to celebrate exceptional artists for their achievements therefore suggests that its purpose is to publicly honor, or recognize, them.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "startle" would mean alarm or surprise, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jacobs and other artists who received the National Heritage Fellowship didn’t expect to receive it or were alarmed by it. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say the fellowship was created to publicly alarm or surprise exceptional artists. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "familiarize" would mean make known or familiar, but the text gives no indication that Jacobs or other recipients of the National Heritage Fellowship were unknown or unfamiliar before receiving the fellowship or that the fellowship was intended to make them familiar to the public. In fact, the text describes recipients as "exceptional" and notes that Jacobs received the award "to celebrate her lifetime contributions to the arts," both of which suggest that Jacobs and other recipients were already well known in the arts world. Choice D is incorrect because "convey" would mean either transport or communicate something, neither of which would be logical in this context. The fellowship doesn’t transport artists, and though the process of awarding the fellowship might communicate something about the artists to the general public, it would be illogical to state that the fellowship communicates the artists themselves. Rather, the fellowship honors artists for their contributions.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the art installation <em>Anthem</em>. In this context, “inventive” means characterized by invention and creativity. The text explains that critics’ responses to the installation involved praise for Tsang’s creative transformation of a space into a dynamic exhibit with huge images and lots of sound. This context conveys that the critics found the piece particularly creative. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that critics praised the installation for being dynamic and including huge images and lots of sound, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe such an exhibit as “restrained,” or limited and not extravagant or showy. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that critics found the installation “inexplicable,” or incapable of being explained or interpreted, since the critics were able to explain their praise for the installation’s transformation of a space with huge images and lots of sound. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that critics praised Tsang for creatively transforming a space into a dynamic exhibit, not that they found the installation “mystifying,” or bewildering and hard to understand. Nothing in the text suggests that the critics couldn’t understand the piece. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of research on income inequality in the 2010s. In this context, "mitigate" means to make less severe or reduce the negative effects of something. The text first identifies a shortcoming in the research: a "myopic focus on a few countries" despite claims of "global relevance." The text then explains that researchers later gained access to new data from previously excluded regions (Africa and Eastern Europe). This context supports the idea that with these new data, researchers would be able to reduce, or mitigate, the identified shortcoming by incorporating a broader range of geographic regions into their studies of income inequality.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "presuppose" would mean to assume in advance that something is true, and it wouldn’t make logical sense to say that researchers later assumed as true in advance a shortcoming they had already encountered. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "categorize" would mean to classify or place into groups. The text indicates that researchers did something about the shortcoming that characterized research on income inequality in the 2010s—limited geographic scope—after they gained access to new data from previously excluded regions. Categorizing a shortcoming doesn’t require access to or analysis of new data; it could be done without any new information, but by analyzing new data, researchers went beyond merely categorizing the shortcoming and instead took action to address it. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "validate" would mean to confirm or substantiate something. The text indicates that researchers did something about a known shortcoming of research on income inequality in the 2010s—limited geographic scope—after they gained access to new data from previously excluded regions. Confirming an already known shortcoming doesn’t require access to or analysis of new data; it could be done without any new information, but by analyzing new data, researchers went beyond merely validating the shortcoming and instead took action to make the shortcoming less severe.</p>

<p>Most animals can regenerate some parts of their bodies, such as skin. But when a three-banded panther worm is cut into three pieces, each piece grows into a new worm. Researchers are investigating this feat partly to learn more about humans’ comparatively limited abilities to regenerate, and they’re making exciting progress. An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration.</p>
<p> </p><p><span aria-level="2" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms. Srivastava has likened EGR to a switch that activates other genes involved in regeneration in panther worms, but how this switch operates in humans remains unclear.</p>
          <p>Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 2 most likely say about Text 1’s characterization of the discovery involving EGR?</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Text 1 based on the information provided. Text 1 discusses the discovery of a regeneration-linked gene, EGR, in both three-banded panther worms (which are capable of full regeneration) and humans (who have relatively limited regeneration abilities). Text 1 characterizes this discovery as “especially promising” and a sign of “exciting progress” in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR’s function in humans isn’t yet known, it’s likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1’s enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava’s team’s observations about EGR in humans. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven’t yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn’t say that Text 1’s excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1’s excitement as premature and overly optimistic. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 does treat Srivastava’s team’s findings with enthusiasm; it describes the discovery of EGR in both three-banded panther worms and humans as promising and exciting. It would be illogical for the author of Text 2 to say that because most others treat the discovery with enthusiasm, Text 1’s enthusiastic characterization of the discovery is unexpected. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 isn’t at all dismissive of Srivastava’s team’s findings; instead, Text 1 is optimistic about the EGR discovery, characterizing it as promising and exciting. There’s nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author of Text 2 would say that Text 1’s praise for the discovery is dismissive, or disdainful. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The underlined sentence explains that contrary to what several studies would suggest, recent European governments suffered electorally after the launch of fiscal austerity programs. The text goes on to indicate that the researchers generated their findings from data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures because the data were based on cases in which governments had set austerity programs to take effect after the next election, a practice the European governments that recently suffered electorally didn’t adhere to, thus introducing a complicating factor resulting in a conflict between the research findings and recent events.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t indicate that the discrepancy described in the text is between observations made in study settings and observations made in real-world settings. Rather, the underlined sentence indicates that the outcome of recent events is contrary to what would be expected based on the findings of several studies. Additionally, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the studies mentioned did not use real-world data; instead, the text indicates that the data used was generated under potentially different circumstances than the recent events. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present a long-standing divergence in research findings but rather a discrepancy between past research findings and recent events that the text goes on to attribute to researchers’ use of data that didn’t reveal the true political risk of austerity measures. Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined sentence notes that there have been some recent exceptions to a general pattern observed in several research studies, it does not go on to attribute this exception to the researchers underestimating inconsistencies in the data. Rather, the text goes on to attribute this to a circumstance (fiscal austerity measures being implemented before an election rather than after) which adds a complicating factor into the data not accounted for in past studies.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that there were many Spanish-language newspapers in cities across Texas in the late 1800s, citing San Antonio as a city that produced eleven such newspapers. The text then goes on to note that in El Paso, there were twenty-two newspapers published in Spanish in the late 1800s, more than any other Texas city. The text then concludes by explaining that the reason for this large number of Spanish-language newspapers was likely El Paso’s location near Mexico and its large population of Spanish speakers. Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to explain that Spanish-language newspapers thrived in Texas cities, especially in El Paso, in the late 1800s.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas today, let alone compare them with newspapers that were published in the 1800s.

Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention whether Spanish-language newspapers published in Texas were also widely read in Mexico.

<p>Because literacy in Nahuatl script, the writing system of the Aztec Empire, was lost after Spain invaded central Mexico in the 1500s, it is unclear exactly how meaning was encoded in the script’s symbols. Although many scholars had assumed that the symbols signified entire words, linguist Alfonso Lacadena theorized in 2008 that they signified units of language smaller than words: individual syllables.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span aria-level="2" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>The growing consensus among scholars of Nahuatl script is that many of its symbols could signify either words or syllables, depending on syntax and content at any given site within a text. For example, the symbol signifying the word <span lang="nah"><em>huipil</em></span> (blouse) in some contexts could signify the syllable “pil” in others, as in the place name “Chipiltepec.” Thus, for the Aztecs, reading required a determination of how such symbols functioned each time they appeared in a text.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. Lacadena’s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signified syllables, but the consensus described in Text 2 is that they can signify either symbols or full words, depending on the context. So the author of Text 2 would likely consider Lacadena’s theory too simplistic: it’s missing the importance of the context in determining the meaning of a symbol. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This conflicts with Text 1’s description of Lacadena’s theory. Lacadena’s theory is that Nahuatl script symbols signified syllables. Choice B is incorrect. This conflicts with Text 1’s description of Lacadena’s theory. Text 1 states that Lacadena’s theory differed from what earlier scholars believed. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how the author of Text 2 would characterize Lacadena’s theory. Neither text mentions how or even if the script changed over time. </p>

The text begins by noting that researchers have long believed that woolly mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points. The text then describes an experiment conducted by an anthropologist to test this hypothesis. According to the text, the results of the experiment led the anthropologist to conclude that hunters using spears with Clovis points likely weren’t the primary cause of the extinction. The anthropologist’s results cast doubt on the long-held hypothesis presented at the beginning of the text and suggest that woolly mammoths may have become extinct in North America due to some other cause.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that researchers have been involved in an ongoing debate. On the contrary, the text suggests that most researchers agree on the cause of the woolly mammoth’s extinction in North America. Choice B is incorrect because the text never mentions any advantages or disadvantages of the method used in the experiment, focusing instead on the results achieved using that method. Choice C is incorrect because the text addresses only one hypothesis, that mammoths were hunted to extinction in North America by humans using spears with Clovis points.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by pointing out an obstacle to observing the astronomical phenomenon of the NCP: the NCP is visible only at night. The text then indicates that, inspired by the ability of some insects and birds to navigate using visualizations of polarized sunlight, researchers devised a way to locate the NCP during daylight. The text then indicates that the researchers mimicked the insects’ and birds’ polarized-light visualization capabilities using a polarimetric camera. Thus, the text notes an obstacle to observing an astronomical phenomenon, mentions a navigational ability of certain animals that inspired a solution to that obstacle, and then explains how researchers used an optical device to mimic that ability.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although it’s reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn’t indicate this is the case, let alone that the NCP is relevant to a majority of navigational tools. Furthermore, the text doesn’t state that researchers discovered that insects and birds navigate without the NCP; rather, it indicates that it’s known that some animals navigate by using skylight polarization to locate the NCP during the day and that this knowledge inspired the method the researchers devised. Choice B is incorrect. Although it’s reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn’t state that this is the case. Furthermore, the text discusses how some animals’ use of navigational strategies based on the same celestial occurrence served as the inspiration for the researchers’ polarized-light approach, not as the basis for a comparison of the relative effectiveness of animal and human methods of navigation. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that humans have typically been able to locate the NCP visually at night and indicates that some animals use the NCP to navigate, the text doesn’t state that humans use the NCP for navigation. The text therefore doesn’t emphasize a difference between how humans and animals use the NCP for this purpose. Furthermore, the text doesn’t suggest that existing navigational instruments will be augmented with polarimetric technologies.</p>

          <p>Asteroid 6478 Gault has experienced intermittent mass loss since at least 2013, but in contrast to some other asteroids with repeated mass-loss episodes, 6478 Gault has not lost mass at its perihelion (the closest point of its orbit to the Sun), and thus the loss is not attributable to solar energy–driven ice vaporization. And as Jane X. Luu et al. point out, the singular nature of impact ejection makes it untenable as an account of multiple loss episodes of similar duration over several years. Instead, Luu et al. are likely correct that 6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by introducing the natural phenomenon of intermittent mass loss with regard to Asteroid 6478 Gault and notes that it curiously has not lost mass at its perihelion like other asteroids typically do. The text then refutes "solar energy–driven ice vaporization" and "the singular nature of impact ejection" as two possible explanations for Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss. Finally, the text presents Luu et al.’s explanation that "6478 Gault is shedding mass due to rotational instability," which the author says is "likely correct." Thus, the overall structure of the text is that it introduces a natural phenomenon, refutes two potential explanations for that phenomenon, and then presents a third explanation for that phenomenon that the author regards as plausible.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t distinguish between multiple observations. It focuses on the single observation that Asteroid 6478 Gault is losing mass and evaluates multiple explanations for the phenomenon. The text also asserts that Luu et al.’s explanation is credible and "likely correct." Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a natural phenomenon, not a specific astronomical finding. In addition, although the text does note flawed reasons for Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss, it doesn’t mention that Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss is based on new evidence. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does evaluate explanations for the cause of Asteroid 6478 Gault’s intermittent mass loss, the text also asserts that Luu et al.’s explanation that they have put forth is persuasive and "likely correct."</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer. An "anomaly" is something that deviates from norms or expectations. In this case, the elkhorn coral is an anomaly because it can pass on somatic mutations, whereas most other animals can’t.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. A "hypothesis" is "a theory about something," but no theories are provided about elkhorn coral in this text, just facts. Choice B is incorrect. "Affinity" represents "an inclination or liking toward something." As genetic mutations tend to occur without any conscious effort, you can’t really have an inclination toward passing on somatic mutations. Choice D is incorrect. "Corroboration" means "evidence to support or prove something." Because elkhorn coral do the opposite of what most animals do, they do not provide corroboration of the theory that somatic mutations can’t be passed onto offspring. Rather, they show the opposite.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. “Demonstrating” means “showing,” and the text describes how de Santana disproved a previous belief in only one species of electric eel by showing that three electric eel species actually exist. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Pretending that there are three species of electric eel might be a fun game for marine biologists, but it wouldn’t prove the existence of more than one species. Choice B is incorrect. Complaining won’t prove anything about eels, so de Santana could not have proved wrong the idea of only one species of electric eel by complaining about it. Choice C is incorrect. “Requiring” means “needing.” It wouldn’t make sense to say that de Santana “needed” there to be three distinct species of electric eel. </p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about Kouchaki and colleagues’ research into how workload affects productivity. In context, “efficient” means effective or well organized. The text indicates that, according to Kouchaki and colleagues’ research, people who worked on hard tasks first were “more skilled and productive” than those who did easy tasks first. This context conveys the idea that despite their sense of accomplishment, the people who chose to do the easy tasks first were less efficient or productive than those who tackled hard tasks first. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks first are less “secretive,” or uncommunicative or silent, than those who do hard tasks first. Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or efficient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones. Choice C is incorrect because “outgoing” means openly friendly, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on Kouchaki and colleagues’ research in which people who worked on hard tasks first were “more skilled and productive” than those who did easy tasks first and were therefore less efficient. Choice D is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that workers who do easy tasks first are less “unsympathetic,” or insensitive or unkind, than those who do hard tasks first. Rather, the text suggests that people are less skillful or efficient if they tackle easy tasks before the hard ones. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it logically completes the text’s discussion about genes related to hibernation. In this context, “dormant” means inactive. The text explains that the same genes that enable certain nonhuman mammal species to hibernate during the winter by altering their bodily processes are also found in our species but have “essentially no effect” on humans’ bodily processes. In other words, these genes don’t function in humans. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “decisive” means has the power to affect the outcome of something, but the text states that genes related to hibernation are instead inactive in humans—that is, the genes don’t affect humans’ bodily processes, although they are present in their bodies. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “lacking” means missing, but the text states that the genes are present in humans, though inactive. Choice C is incorrect because “variable” means characterized by the potential to change, but the text indicates that these genes don’t change in their effect on humans’ bodily processes; instead, the genes are consistently inactive in humans. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Arturo A. Schomburg’s collection. In this context, the phrase “depended on” means relied on. The text explains that Schomburg, wanting to preserve “books, art, and other materials” created by peoples of African descent from around the world, built a large collection of these objects. The text also states that in order to obtain these items, Schomburg asked friends and colleagues who were traveling internationally to bring them back for him. This implies that he wouldn’t have been able to create his collection without help. Thus, the context supports the idea that Schomburg relied on, or depended on, friends and colleagues to build his collection. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “admired” means respected and approved of. Although it’s reasonable to expect that Schomburg respected his friends and colleagues, the text doesn’t discuss any such aspect of their relationships. The text focuses instead on what Schomburg asked his friends and colleagues to do to help build his collection. Choice B is incorrect because “disagreed with” means held an opposing belief, and nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg and his friends or colleagues held opposing views on any subject. In fact, the text strongly implies that Schomburg’s friends and colleagues supported him in his goal of preserving objects of importance for Black history and culture by bringing him such objects from around the world. Choice C is incorrect because “warned” means informed someone in advance about something dangerous, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. Nothing in the text suggests that Schomburg thought his friends and colleagues were in any danger, let alone that he warned them of danger. </p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because, based on the information presented in the texts, it represents how Focarelli and Panetta would most likely respond to Fan’s findings. Text 1 indicates that Fan found that a newspaper merger would result in a rise in subscription prices. This rise wouldn’t benefit customers, who would have to pay more for news after a merger. Text 2 presents Focarelli and Panetta’s argument that merger research tends to focus too much on what happens immediately after the merger. Text 2 goes on to describe their finding that mergers can be economically beneficial for consumers over the long term. This suggests that Focarelli and Panetta would encourage Fan to investigate the long-term effect of the hypothetical newspaper merger on subscription prices.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t indicate that Focarelli and Panetta connect the effects of mergers to specific locations. Instead, Focarelli and Panetta focus on the length of time over which the effects of mergers should be evaluated. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that Focarelli and Panetta found that merged companies experience "efficiency gains" over the long term, meaning that their expenses go down relative to their output, not that their expenses increase. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no indication in Text 2 that Focarelli and Panetta believe that the newspaper industry is different from any other industry when it comes to the effects of mergers. Although their own research was about consumer banking, Text 2 suggests that they view their conclusions as applicable to mergers in general.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence of the text establishes that scientists didn’t know much about the ocean floor in the 1950s. The second sentence, which is underlined, describes what many scientists thought at the time—that the ocean floor was mostly flat. The remainder of the text establishes that the ocean floor is far from flat, citing research conducted by Marie Tharp and Bruce Heezen. Thus, the purpose of the underlined sentence is to identify a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen showed to be wrong.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although Tharp and Heezen’s work with sonar data in the Atlantic Ocean is mentioned later in the text, the underlined sentence doesn’t describe the design of their experiment. Instead, it identifies a belief held by scientists that Tharp and Heezen demonstrated to be wrong. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence presents a belief held by many scientists in the 1950s; nowhere does the text mention a disagreement between Tharp and Heezen, whom the text describes as research partners working together to map the ocean floor. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn’t present data in support of a claim; instead, it presents a scientific belief that Tharp and Heezen’s work showed to be wrong.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence explains that Bernabei and his team studied growth rings to obtain information about the ancient oak planks found during a construction project in Rome. The next sentence presents what the researchers learned: the wood from the planks came from France’s Jura region, which is far from Rome. The underlined sentence then presents the implications of the findings about the planks: the wood must have been brought to Rome by boat, a difficult task that suggests Roman trade routes were complex. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to present a conclusion about Roman trade routes based on the team’s findings. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the team thought the ancient planks were used in the construction of a boat, nor does the underlined sentence question that conclusion. Instead, the text states that the wood could only have been transported from Jura to Rome in a boat. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence simply offers a conclusion drawn from the team’s findings about the likely place of origin of the ancient planks; the text never mentions why oak was chosen for the planks instead of other wood. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole addresses any methods that Romans used in constructing subways. Instead, the underlined sentence offers a conclusion drawn from the team’s findings about the likely place of origin of the ancient wooden planks discovered. </p>

          <p><strong>Text 1</strong></p>
<p>Literary scholars have struggled with the vastness of Nigerian writer Wole Soyinka’s collective works of drama (spanning over 20 plays in total). It is best, however, to understand Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist chronologically. Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, with each one representing a particular thematic and stylistic cohesion: the 1960s, the two decades between 1970 and 1990, and lastly, from roughly 1990 onwards. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong> </p>
<p>It is tempting to impose a linear sense of order on the expanse of Wole Soyinka’s body of work as a dramatist. However, critics who have considered Soyinka’s plays to fit neatly into three phases overlook potential commonalities in Soyinka’s work that span across these phases. Additionally, this view may discount significant differences in the styles and content of plays written around the same time. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The author of Text 1 states that Soyinka’s progression as a playwright can be considered to fall into three periods, implying that this is a helpful way to understand his works. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, challenges this view and says that it overlooks potential commonalities and differences in Soyinka’s work across what Text 1 calls distinctive stylistic phases. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This choice overstates the central claim of Text 2. The author of Text 2 argues against the chronological progression supported in Text 1, but does not go so far as to say that Soyinka’s style remained consistent. In fact, Text 2 points out “significant differences in styles and content” among Soyinka’s plays. Choice C is incorrect. Neither of the texts mention Soyinka’s poetry, nor do they rank his dramatic writing relative to his other work. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text discusses the political aspects of Soyinka’s plays, nor do they make any claims about whether they have changed over time. </p>

          <p>Jackie Ormes’s <em>Torchy Brown in Dixie to Harlem</em> (1937–38) was the first comic strip by a Black woman to appear in a widely read newspaper. The strip tells the story of Torchy, a young woman who leaves Mississippi to become a performer in New York City. Torchy’s story reflects the experience of the Great Migration (1910–1970), when millions of Black Americans left the South in search of opportunities in other parts of the United States. <em>Torchy Brown</em> thus shows how Ormes used comics to comment humorously on issues affecting Black Americans, which she continued to do throughout her career.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the early British postal system. In this context, "reforms" most nearly means attempts at improving something. The text indicates that the pay-upon-delivery postage method led to fee avoidance on the part of recipients. It then says that action was taken to improve the postal system, giving examples such as the move to having the sender pay and affixing stamps to indicate payment had been received. These represent revisions to the system intended to improve its functioning; therefore, "reforms" most logically completes the text.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "investigations" most nearly means attempts to understand something. And although it is plausible that an attempt to improve the postal system would involve investigations, nothing in the text provides a logical basis for understanding the example of changes like affixing stamps to letters as an investigation. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "expansions" most nearly means additions to something. Although the text indicates that some new policies were adopted, nothing in the text suggests that the overall number of policies increased, which expansions would seem to entail. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "possessions" most nearly means items of personal property or things that otherwise belong to, or are part of, something. The text provides no logical context for understanding changes like affixing stamps to letters as possessions.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jung and her team’s study of acts of kindness. In this context, “foster” means encourage or promote the development of. The text indicates that Jung and her team found that seeing a helpful (or prosocial) act makes a bystander more likely to help someone else, which can in turn inspire additional people to help others. That is, the team showed that single acts of kindness can foster additional prosocial acts across a group. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Jung and her team found that single acts of kindness “require,” or depend on or make obligatory, broader prosocial (or helpful) behavior across a group. There’s no suggestion in the text that individual acts of kindness can only occur if other prosocial acts have already occurred, and the text indicates only that an act of kindness <em>can </em>inspire additional helpful acts, not that it necessarily will do so. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses on a possible direct effect of individual acts of kindness, or single helpful actions, and it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that actions can “remember,” or hold a memory of, something. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Jung and her team found that single acts of kindness can “discourage,” or hinder, prosocial (or helpful) behavior across a group. On the contrary, the text states that Jung and her team found that seeing a helpful act makes a bystander <em>more</em> likely to help someone else, which can in turn inspire even more people to help others. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately portrays the main purpose of the text. At the beginning of the text, Tom asserts that he and the other people staging the play are doing so only for “a little amusement among ourselves” and aren’t interested in attracting an audience or any attention with the production. Then, Tom promises that the play they chose is modest and appropriate, and he further reasons that using the well-written prose of “some respectable author” is better than using their own words. Overall, the main purpose of the text is to convey Tom’s promise that the play will be inoffensive and involve only a few people. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t indicate that Tom had earlier intentions for the play’s performance or that anything has changed since the group first decided to stage a play. Instead, the text focuses on how harmless the entire endeavor will be. Choice C is incorrect. Although Tom mentions that using the words of a “respectable author” will be better than using their own words, he never addresses the idea that the people around him generally aren’t skilled enough to stage a play. Choice D is incorrect because in the text Tom specifically says that they “want no audience, no publicity,” which indicates that they don’t plan on promoting the play at all. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about handedness in animals. As used in this context, “recognizable” means apparent or identifiable. The text indicates that handedness is “easy to observe in humans,” but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of “less” before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “intriguing,” or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more fascinating in humans.  Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less “significant,” or important or meaningful, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn’t suggest that handedness is more significant in humans. Choice D is incorrect because “useful,” or functional or helpful, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the ease with which researchers can determine whether an animal or person is right- or left-handed, not on how useful handedness in nonhuman animals is compared with handedness in humans. </p>

The text describes how the narrator watches people working out at a gym through a window near a bus stop.

Thus, the main purpose of the text is to describe an activity that the narrator finds amusing.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text isn’t about the narrator beginning middle school. The text describes how the narrator finds people working out at a gym amusing and makes no mention of school life. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any problems that the narrator currently has or has overcome. It just describes how the narrator finds watching people work out amusing. Choice D is incorrect because the narrator invents the made-up movie mentioned in the text. The text doesn’t indicate that the narrator has seen a movie in a theater. The focus of the text is on the narrator watching people at the gym, not watching a movie.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jacob Lawrence’s artistic process. In this context, “observant” means watchful and perceptive. The text emphasizes that the “close attention” Lawrence paid to “all the details” of his neighborhood allowed him to reflect subtle elements of “the beauty and vitality of the Black experience” in his artwork. This context indicates that being observant of his surroundings was an important part of Lawrence’s work as an artist. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was “skeptical,” or had an attitude of doubt in general or about particular things, let alone that skepticism was important to him as an artist. Rather than indicating that he was skeptical, the text focuses on how Lawrence paid careful attention to everything around him and reflected his observations in his artwork. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was “critical,” which in this context would mean inclined to criticize harshly or unfairly. Rather than indicating that Lawrence found fault in things, the text suggests that he paid careful attention to everything around him and that his artwork reflects this careful attention. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Lawrence was “confident,” or self-assured. Rather than addressing how Lawrence felt about himself and how that feeling affected his artistic process, the text emphasizes the careful attention Lawrence paid to everything around him—attention that allowed him to capture subtle elements of a particular place and time in his artwork. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. In this context, “involuntarily” means done without any control, or by reflex. The text explains that when a person’s diaphragm repeatedly contracts and results in hiccups (which may be beneficial for infants), those muscle contractions are “uncontrollable.” This context indicates that the diaphragm contractions occur without the person’s control. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t support the logical relationship established in the text’s discussion of diaphragm contractions and hiccups. The text indicates that although specific causes for hiccups haven’t been identified, it may be the case that the muscle contractions that occur have an important purpose in infants. It wouldn’t make sense to say that even though the contractions occur “beneficially,” or with a good or helpful effect, they might play a positive role in infants’ breathing regulation. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups are “uncontrollable.” Because those muscle contractions are described as happening automatically and without the person’s control, it wouldn’t make sense to describe them as occurring “strenuously,” or in a way that requires great effort or energy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe the quality of the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups beyond stating that they are “uncontrollable.” Nothing in the text indicates that those muscle contractions occur “smoothly,” or evenly and continuously. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The first two sentences introduce the idea that soil and rocks can be moved from one location to another by something other than rivers and streams. The underlined sentence then states that the term used by scientists to refer to this process is “aeolian transport.” The discussion that follows explains what aeolian transport is (the movement of small geological materials over potentially great distances by the wind) and describes an example of a study that found that dust particles had been moved by aeolian transport from Australia to Antarctica. Thus, the underlined portion introduces a scientific term that is used in the discussion that follows. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion of the text doesn’t present any remarks from Melisa Diaz, nor does it suggest that Diaz and her team encountered difficulties in their study. Instead, the phrase in quotation marks in the underlined portion simply presents a term that is used by scientists to refer to a specific process discussed in the text. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in either the underlined portion or the text as a whole suggests that the findings of the study presented in the text were surprising or unexpected. In fact, the text suggests that Diaz and her team wanted to see if aeolian transport could explain the appearance of certain geological materials in Antarctica, and their findings did indeed confirm the involvement of aeolian transport. Choice D is incorrect. Although the first sentence of the text mentions soil and rocks, which are two different kinds of geological material, the underlined portion doesn’t refer to these materials, nor does it explain the difference between them. Rather, the underlined portion introduces the scientific term “aeolian transport,” which is used in the discussion that follows. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of wild rice. As used in this context, "sensitive" means vulnerable or easily affected. The text indicates that climate change is causing the lakes to get deeper, which consequently threatens the wild rice that grows in the area. The text goes on to state that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to uproot from the bottom of the lake. This context supports the idea that the plants are sensitive to water depth during early stages of development.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "immune" means protected or shielded, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text explains that deep water can cause young wild-rice plants to become uprooted and destroyed, indicating that these plants are harmed by deep water, not protected from it. Choice C is incorrect because "limited" means confined or restrained, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text explains that water depth can negatively affect young wild-rice plants but doesn’t suggest that water depth limits or restrains the plants. Choice D is incorrect because "receptive" means open or tolerant, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text doesn’t indicate that the wild-rice plants are open to or tolerant of an increase in water depth but rather the opposite: an increase in water depth can harm young wild-rice plants.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The word "reaching" in this text means "to arrive" at Earth. Before, the light had been traveling across space; now, it had arrived at Earth.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. "Consulting with" means "seeking advice or information from someone." Light is not alive, so it can’t consult with Earth. Choice C is incorrect. It’s confusing to say that starlight is "only now running to Earth," both because light doesn’t literally "run" and because the text is describing the moment the light touches Earth, not the period of time when it’s traveling to Earth. Choice D is incorrect. This might be tempting, as "clinging to" has a connotation of "sticking to." It wouldn’t make sense to say that the light was "only now" clinging to Earth.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the origins of the unique dialect of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico. In this context, "traced" means tracked back to. The text notes that the regional variety of Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has its roots in the language of the Taínos and in the West African language of Yoruba. This context supports the idea that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced back to Yoruba.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be "surrendered," or handed over on demand, to the pronunciation in Yoruba. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that the way certain vowel sounds are pronounced in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish has been "announced," or officially declared or proclaimed. According to the text, elements of the dialect have been inherited or borrowed from African languages, and the relationship between the pronunciation of certain vowels in the Puerto Rican dialect and in Yoruba is an example of this inheritance, suggesting that the pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect can be traced to Yoruba. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents the statement about the relationship between vowel pronunciation in the Puerto Rican dialect of Spanish and in Yoruba as an example to support the claim that African languages have contributed to the Puerto Rican dialect. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that the pronunciation of certain vowel sounds in the Puerto Rican dialect can be "offered," or presented as a gift, to the pronunciation in Yoruba.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Nuttall’s 1886 research paper. In this context, “acknowledged” means recognized as having a certain status. The text indicates that other researchers recognized Nuttall’s work as groundbreaking because of its “convincing demonstration” related to the age of the ancient sculptures. In other words, the researchers recognized the groundbreaking status of Nuttall’s work. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “ensured” would mean to have guaranteed or made sure something was the case. The text states that other researchers gave Nuttall’s work recognition after it was published, but there’s no indication that they contributed to the work or had any involvement that would have allowed them to make sure the work would be groundbreaking. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that other researchers “denied,” or refused to admit or accept, that Nuttall’s work was groundbreaking; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its “convincing demonstration” related to the age of the ancient sculptures. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that other researchers “underestimated,” or undervalued, Nuttall’s work; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its “convincing demonstration” related to the age of the ancient sculptures. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of environmental management along the US and Mexican border. In this context, "requires" means needs in order to perform a task. The text indicates that because ecosystems span the border, actions taken by the government on one side of the border can affect the environment in the nation on the other side of the border, which makes international cooperation crucial. In other words, because actions on one side of the US and Mexican border can affect the other side of the border, managing environmental matters along the border requires coordination between the two governments.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because "praises" in this context would mean to express a favorable judgment, but the text doesn’t describe approval expressed by anyone, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that environmental management itself praises intergovernmental coordination. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "reports" would mean gives an account. Although coordination between the US and Mexican governments likely would involve some sort of reporting, the text doesn’t describe any such practice. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, "advises" would mean recommends a course of action, and although governments can advise one another, it wouldn’t make sense to say that environmental management itself makes recommendations.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text begins by mentioning scholarly accounts of the Chicano movement, which the underlined portion describes as tending "to focus on the most militant, outspoken figures in the movement," making the movement as a whole seem uniformly radical. The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant figures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement’s participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement’s participants.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does present a trend in scholarship on the Chicano movement, the text does not indicate that other scholars have reevaluated their methods in light of Herrera’s work. It only indicates that Herrera’s work suggests that the work of those other scholars does not provide a complete picture of the Chicano movement. Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does identify an aspect of the Chicano movement that the text indicates has been overemphasized, the text does not discuss the political orientations of the scholars whose work is mentioned in the text. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does summarize the conventional method for analyzing the Chicano movement, the rest of the text does not address the effectiveness of "comparatively low-profile neighborhood institutions and projects." Instead, the text suggests that those projects were led by people with a variety of approaches to community activism.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the helmets found in Denmark. In this context, “justify” means confirm or give reasons for. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical about the supposed Viking origin of two helmets found in Denmark. The radiocarbon dating of the helmets conducted by Vandkilde and colleagues demonstrates that the helmets date from the Nordic Bronze Age, making the helmets too old to have belonged to Vikings. This context supports the idea that the scholars’ skepticism is justified. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “anticipate” means expect or come before, neither of which would make sense in context. The text indicates that scholars have long been skeptical of the idea that the helmets belonged to Vikings. Because the skepticism has existed for a long time, Vandkilde and colleagues’ research couldn’t be said to anticipate it. Instead, the radiocarbon dating results justify or confirm the scholar’s skepticism. Choice B is incorrect because “inspect” means examine or review, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. Research findings are inanimate and therefore unable to inspect scholars’ skepticism. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues found that the helmets are from the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers’ findings justify, not inspect, the scholars’ skepticism. Choice C is incorrect because “reveal” means uncover or report, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the origin of two helmets, which some people believe belonged to Vikings. Vandkilde and colleagues tested the helmets and found that they date to the Nordic Bronze Age and therefore are much older than the Vikings. This context suggests that the researchers’ findings confirm or justify the scholars’ skepticism, which was already known so didn’t need to be revealed. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The expression “reconcile to” means “to cause (a person) to accept something difficult or disagreeable.” The text suggests that John wants his mother to accept his desire to travel, even though she doesn’t like that idea. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This doesn’t make sense. John doesn’t want his mother to apologize for his own desire to travel—he wants her to accept his desire to travel. Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t suggest that John wants his mother to match his desire to travel. Rather, he wants her to accept his desire to travel even though she doesn’t like it. Choice D is incorrect. This is tempting, because it seems to pick up on the idea of people “reconciling” after a fight, but it actually doesn’t make sense. The text never suggests that John’s mother was “united with” the idea of him traveling in the past—if anything, it seems like she’s always been against it. Besides, it would be strange to say that a person “reunites with” a notion. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The text describes an experiment wherein space scientists compared plant growth in terrestrial and lunar soil conditions. It then discusses the findings of the study, including the fact that all the seeds germinated but that the plants grown in lunar soil exhibited signs of stress.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text doesn’t address this question, and never describes any specific characteristics of either soil. It merely describes the outcome of an experiment that exposed a plant species to lunar soil conditions. Choice B is incorrect. The text never compares methods of assessing indicators of stress—instead, it simply mentions several stress indicators observed in the study (red pigmentation, reduced leaf size, and inhibited growth rates). Choice C is incorrect. The text doesn’t present any evidence that we could never achieve seed germination in lunar habitats, and in fact states that the seeds in the lunar soil did germinate.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, “suggestion” most nearly means trace. The text portrays the narrator standing on the deck of a boat, admiring the view of nature afforded by this position: “My soul had left its body to lose itself in the wild unrestrained beauty around me,” says the narrator, “and only left a trembling suggestion of its existence within me.” This intense response to beauty is such that the narrator’s soul seems to disengage from its body, leaving behind only a barely detectible indication of its presence there. In other words, the narrator senses only a trace of soul left in the body. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “suggestion” can refer to an implied or indirectly expressed opinion, the text doesn’t portray the narrator expressing an opinion; instead, the narrator is explaining an experience of intense emotion. Choice C is incorrect. While “suggestion” might be used in some contexts to refer to the tactful expression of a differing viewpoint, it doesn’t refer to the dispute or difference of opinion itself. Moreover, the text doesn’t portray a dispute between characters with differing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “suggestion” might be used to refer to a politely worded command, the text doesn’t portray a scenario in which someone receives such a command. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how rising prices affected demand for vintage cassette tapes. In this context, "engendering" means producing or causing to exist. The text indicates that the effect of a dramatic increase in the price of vintage cassettes was counterintuitive, or contrary to what would typically be expected. Generally, when prices rise, demand falls—but the text indicates that in this case, buyers who previously had no interest in cassettes "thronged the market" (that is, many of them began purchasing cassettes) because they saw the cassettes as potential investments. This context conveys that the rising prices surprisingly produced significant demand, producing many new buyers for vintage cassettes.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe the price increase itself—rather than sellers of vintage cassettes—as "exploiting," or unfairly or selfishly taking advantage of, demand. Further, wanting to take advantage of new demand would be a motivation for a price increase, not a counterintuitive effect of it. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "monetizing" would mean utilizing as a source of profit, and it wouldn’t make sense to describe a price increase itself, rather than sellers of vintage cassettes, as using demand as a source of profit; moreover, seeking to profit when there’s new demand would be a reason for price increases, not a counterintuitive effect of them. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, "appraising" would mean assessing the value or significance of something. The text focuses on a rise in prices of vintage cassettes, and while it would be reasonable to suggest that sellers might have appraised demand for those cassettes, it wouldn’t make sense to suggest that a price increase itself could do such an assessment; moreover, an appraisal of demand would most likely precede a price increase rather than be an effect of it.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how historians have treated rank-and-file (ordinary) workers in their analyses. In this context, "marginalize" means treat as unimportant or relatively powerless within a group or society. The text explains that according to Austin McCoy, historians have tended to treat "political, business, and labor leaders" as the "major actors" involved in making changes in organized labor in the period after the Second World War. By emphasizing the contributions of these leaders, historians have in effect minimized the contributions of ordinary workers, treating them as relatively unimportant and "nearly devoid of agency," thereby marginalizing them.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "epitomize" would mean either serve as an ideal example of something or make into an example of something, neither of which would make sense. In stating that historians have tended to characterize political, business, and labor leaders as the primary actors responsible for changes in the post-Second World War labor movement in a manner that minimizes the influence of ordinary workers, the text suggests that historians have tended to present ordinary workers as unimportant to or uninfluential within the movement, not that historians themselves serve as examples of ordinary workers, or that historians in their analyses have made ordinary workers into examples of the changes that occurred. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "extol" would mean praise highly or glorify. The text states that historians have tended to present ordinary workers as being "nearly devoid of agency," thereby minimizing their importance. It therefore wouldn’t make sense to say that in doing so, historians have tended to praise or glorify them. Choice D is incorrect because "substantiate" would mean verify with evidence, and nothing in the text suggests that historians have verified rank-and-file workers or their contributions in their analyses. If anything, the text suggests the opposite, implying that by minimizing workers’ agency in organized labor, historians have likely overlooked evidence demonstrating their influence.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Jha and Kremen’s finding about bees’ foraging behavior. In this context, “homogeneous” means uniform or of the same kind. The text indicates that some models predict that the distance that bees travel when they’re foraging declines as the density of flowers increases. The text goes on to say, however, that Jha and Kremen identified a circumstance in which bees don’t behave this way. Specifically, if bees encounter “patches of low species richness”—that is, patches in which the flowers are largely from the same species—they’ll travel beyond those patches to get varied food resources. This context thus suggests that bees don’t behave as some models predict if the dense patches of flowers the bees encounter are homogeneous. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave differently than some models predict if the bees encounter flower patches that are not rich in species, not if the flowers are “depleted,” or emptied or reduced in quality or quantity. Although it could be true that bees are likely to leave depleted patches in search of more resources, the text doesn’t indicate that Jha and Kremen investigated that possibility. Choice C is incorrect because there’s no information in the text suggesting that bees will not behave as some models predict if flowers in patches are “immature,” or not fully developed. Instead, the text indicates that Jha and Kremen found that bees will behave contrary to some models’ predictions if the flower patches are not rich in species. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that bees’ behavior will be inconsistent with the predictions of some models if the flower patches that the bees encounter are of low species richness, not if the flowers are in patches that are “dispersed,” or widely scattered. Although the text does describe bees as leaving patches that are not rich in species to forage elsewhere, there’s no suggestion that Jha and Kremen found that the distance between dense flower patches affects whether the bees behave as some models predict. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Gardley’s play. In this context, “comprises” means constitutes or makes up the totality of, and the text indicates that <em>The House That Will Not Stand</em> had an “all-female cast” that stands in some relationship to “an array of female characters” in the play. Because all cast members are female, the characters must be played by these female cast members; therefore the cast constitutes, or comprises, the collection of characters. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, “engulfs” would mean encloses or overwhelms, and although it is fairly common to describe an actor as embodying (or personifying realistically) a character, there is nothing in the text to suggest that the cast members enclosed or overwhelmed the characters they played. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “encourages” would mean inspires with courage or hope. Although the text does mention “a strong mother and several daughters dealing with individual struggles,” which might suggest that there are moments of encouragement among the characters during the play, there is nothing to suggest that the cast members encouraged the characters they portrayed. Choice D is incorrect because, in this context, “provokes” would mean instigates or incites to anger. Nothing in the text addresses provocation or what it might mean for actors to provoke the characters they are playing. </p>

<p>Despite its beautiful prose, <em>The Guns of August</em>, Barbara Tuchman’s 1962 analysis of the start of World War I, has certain weaknesses as a work of history. It fails to address events in Eastern Europe just before the outbreak of hostilities, thereby giving the impression that Germany was the war’s principal instigator. Had Tuchman consulted secondary works available to her by scholars such as Luigi Albertini, she would not have neglected the influence of events in Eastern Europe on Germany’s actions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span aria-level="2" role="heading">Text 2</span></strong></p>
<p>Barbara Tuchman’s <em>The Guns of August </em>is an engrossing if dated introduction to World War I. Tuchman’s analysis of primary documents is laudable, but her main thesis that European powers committed themselves to a catastrophic outcome by refusing to deviate from military plans developed prior to the conflict is implausibly reductive.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. Both texts are critical of <em>The Guns of August</em>, but for different reasons: the author of Text 1 argues that Tuchman missed an important factor leading up to the war because she didn’t consult secondary sources, and the author of Text 2 argues that Tuchman’s main thesis is "reductive," which is a close synonym for "overly simplistic."</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. This choice’s summary of Text 1 is accurate, but Text 2 never says that Tuchman’s most interesting claims result from her original research. Choice C is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. Text 1 never says that <em>The Guns of August</em> is worthwhile to read despite its research weaknesses. Text 2 does call out a weakness of Tuchman’s interpretation of events, but it also praises her analysis of primary sources. Choice D is incorrect. This doesn’t accurately describe the difference. Text 1 actually says that Tuchman "fails to address" the influence of events in Eastern Europe, while Text 2 says that Tuchman’s thesis was that European powers (not Eastern European leaders) were committed to military plans.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, “answers” most nearly means fulfills. In the text, Fabry and Busman claim that the robots manufactured by their company are more efficient than human workers, which they refer to as “the human machine.” Fabry observes that the human machine “no longer answers the requirements of <em>modern engineering</em>.” That is, human workers are incapable of meeting the rigorous needs of modern, industrialized workplaces. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts “answers” can mean explains, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because the topic under discussion is human beings’ inability to perform labor efficiently, not their inability to engage in discussion or explanation. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “answers” can mean rebuts, or proves a claim or argument to be false, it wouldn’t make sense to speak of proving<em> </em>requirements<em> </em>to be false; requirements might or might not be reasonable, but they can’t be verified as truthful or untruthful, as claims or accusations can. Choice C is incorrect. Although in some contexts, “answers” can mean defends against criticism, or justifies, it doesn’t have that meaning in this context because the opinion that Fabry expresses is that human workers can no longer fulfill the requirements of modern workplaces, not that they have ceased to justify those requirements or to defend them against criticism; indeed, there is no suggestion in the text that workers ever defended those requirements. </p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The first sentence tells us that video meetings are “less conducive to” (meaning less good for) brainstorming.

<p>In 2007, a team led by Alice Storey analyzed a chicken bone found in El Arenal, Chile, dating it to 1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region, bringing their own chickens. Storey also found that the El Arenal chicken shared a unique genetic mutation with the ancient chicken breeds of the Polynesian Islands in the Pacific.

<p>An Australian research team weakened the case for a Polynesian origin for the El Arenal chicken by confirming that the mutation identified by Storey has occurred in breeds from around the world. More recently, though, a team led by Agusto Luzuriaga-Neira found that South American chicken breeds and Polynesian breeds share other genetic markers that European breeds lack. Thus, the preponderance of evidence now favors a Polynesian origin.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 indicates that Storey found a genetic mutation in South American chickens from before the European invasion and in Polynesian chickens, which implies that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian people. Text 2 explains that the genetic mutation Storey found is in chickens from all over the world, thus undercutting the mutation as evidence of a Polynesian origin. However, Text 2 goes on to say “[m]ore recently” Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues found multiple genetic markers shared by South American and Polynesian chickens but “that European breeds lack,” which strongly suggests a Polynesian origin for the South American chickens. This indicates that the author of Text 2 believes Luzuriaga-Neira’s evidence for a Polynesian origin is compelling while Storey’s evidence has been undermined. Thus, the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with the underlined statement and believes Luzuriaga-Neira and colleagues’ evidence for the statement is stronger than Storey’s evidence is. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because both texts indicate that chickens were introduced to South America before the arrival of Europeans. Text 1 states that the El Arenal chicken bone dates from “1321–1407 CE—over a century before Europeans invaded the region” and concludes that these chickens were likely brought to South America by Polynesians. While Text 2 is not as explicit about the time period as Text 1 is, nothing in Text 2 undermines the timing of events ascribed to Storey’s account in Text 1. Choice B is incorrect because both texts agree that chickens were first brought to South America by Polynesian peoples (the underlined claim), and nothing in Text 2 suggests that this claim is in any way deficient because the possibility that animals could have been transferred from South America to Polynesia was not explicitly addressed. Choice C is incorrect because the criticism that Text 2 raises about the ideas in Text 1 is specifically about whether the single genetic mutation cited by Storey in fact supports the idea of a Polynesian origin for South American chickens. There is nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the underlined sentence (Storey’s conclusion) is deficient because it is based on an assumption about the genetic uniformity of European chickens. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately reflects the main purpose of the text. The text portrays Miss Pyne as awaiting the arrival of a carriage while Martha brings strawberries and flowers from the garden into the house. The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks "stately and calm," the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was "wide open to the long-expected guest," which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne’s anticipation and Martha’s activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest’s arrival. The text indicates that the guest was "long-expected," but characterizing Miss Pyne as "stately and calm" conflicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a moment in time when two characters are awaiting the arrival of a visitor rather than an extended period over which characters could be seen changing. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text describes the activity indoors (Miss Pyne sitting calmly), it describes a higher level of activity, not stillness, outside (Martha bringing fruit and flowers and birds singing).</p>

Text 1 claims that digital art doesn’t require the same amount of skill as creating physical art and that “the technology is doing most of the work.” Text 2 states that digital art requires “knowing the fundamentals of art” and that many digital artists begin their work on paper and then transfer it to a digital format using “sophisticated software” and “a variety of colors and techniques.” Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely insist that digital art requires artistic abilities even if it employs less traditional tools. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because neither text discusses nondigital means of displaying art. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 doesn’t address whether it’s harder to use a tablet and stylus than it is to use paint and a brush. Text 2 does argue that digital art requires skills that aren’t part of the traditional methods for producing art, but the text doesn’t address relative difficulty.

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Juarez. In this context, “important” means marked by significant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, became a certain kind of figure in Mexico’s history. It then supports that claim by describing some of the “many significant accomplishments” from Juarez’s long tenure in office. This context conveys that Juarez is a significant and consequential figure in Mexico’s history. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez’s role as the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was “unpredictable,” or tended to behave in ways that couldn’t be predicted. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was a particularly “secretive” figure, or that he tended to keep things private or hidden from others. Instead, the text focuses on things that are known about Juarez: that he was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, that he had a lengthy tenure, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national government’s authority and advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office. Rather than suggesting that Juarez was an “ordinary,” or common and typical, figure in Mexico’s history, this context conveys that Juarez was instead a notable figure. </p>

<p>A tiny, unusual fossil in a piece of 99-million-year-old amber is of the extinct species <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em>. The <em>O. khaungraae </em>fossil consists of a rounded skull with a thin snout and a large eye socket.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it reflects what the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say about what the researchers in Text 1 initially thought. Text 1 focuses on the discovery of a strange fossil consisting of the skull of the extinct species <em>Oculudentavis khaungraae</em>. According to Text 1, the fossil has features that appear to be avian, or related to birds, which led researchers to initially think that the fossil might be a very small avian dinosaur. Text 2 begins by noting the discovery of a second fossil similar to the one discussed in Text 1, then explains that based on detailed studies of both fossils, paleontologists think that the two creatures were probably unusual lizards, even though the skulls appeared avian at first. This suggests that the paleontologists in Text 2 recognize that the fossils do indeed look like they could be related to birds. For this reason, the paleontologists in Text 2 would most likely say that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1—that the fossil was avian—is understandable, even if the fossil is probably not avian but rather is from a lizard. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that the fossils initially looked avian, so the paleontologists described in Text 2 wouldn’t be confused by the researchers in Text 1 initially thinking that <em>O. khaungraae</em> might be related to birds. The paleontologists would find that initial thought understandable, not confusing. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 never mentions lizards, so it wouldn’t make sense for the paleontologists in Text 2 to say that the researchers in Text 1 mistakenly assumed that <em>O. khaungraae</em> must be a lizard. Choice D is incorrect. Although the paleontologists in Text 2 might agree that the initial thought of the researchers in Text 1 was reasonable, nothing in Text 2 suggests that the two skulls were shaped differently. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of diadromous fish. In this context, "demarcated from" means separate or set apart from. The text indicates that diadromous fish differ from euryhaline fish in that diadromous fish "migrate between freshwater and marine biomes during their life," whereas euryhaline fish do not relocate to a different biome because they can tolerate higher salinity environments. Therefore, this context suggests that because of differences between their migration patterns, diadromous fish are distinct and can be demarcated from euryhaline fish.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that diadromous fish migrate and relocate, the text does not suggest that diadromous fish would be "reconstituted as," or formed again as, anything new. Only their environments change and not the fish themselves. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not suggest that diadromous fish can be "conflated with," or combined with, euryhaline fish. Instead, the text distinguishes the two types of fish by pointing out their differences with regard to migration and tolerance for salinity. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that based on migration habits and tolerance for salinity, diadromous fish are different from euryhaline fish; so it would not make logical sense to say that diadromous fish would be "derived from," or be an extension of or result from, euryhaline fish.</p>

        <p>Choice C is the best answer. The first three sentences describe the general situation: these early films have been lost, and we only know about them from small pieces of evidence. The rest of the text offers specific examples of the small pieces of evidence. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The fact that we only know about these lost early films from small pieces of evidence isn’t presented as a “complex problem”—that’s too extreme.

Choice B is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. There’s no “debate” presented in the text, so there’s no “side” for the text to support. Choice D is incorrect.

<blockquote>
<p>Louis Pipestone tended the petition like a garden. He kept it with him at all times. In town, his eyes sharpened when he noticed a tribal member who hadn’t yet signed. Wherever they were—at the gas pump, mercantile [general store], at Henry’s [Café], on the road, or outside the clinic and hospital—Louis cornered them. If they were waiting for a baby to be born, he’d have them sign. If they were laughing, if they were arguing. If they were taking a child home from school, they signed.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the text’s main purpose. The text indicates that Louis always had his petition with him, asked everyone he encountered to sign it if they hadn’t already, and lists several comical circumstances in which he might try to get someone to sign. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to illustrate Louis’s dedicated focus on getting people to sign the petition.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Louis was aggressive in seeking signatures for the petition—for example, saying that he "cornered" people—nothing in the text addresses how those people feel toward Louis, let alone that they are refusing his request. Choice B is incorrect because, other than portraying Louis’s commitment to gathering signatures, the text doesn’t discuss community members’ attitudes toward Louis or the petition. Choice C is incorrect because the text never mentions the attitudes of the people Louis approaches toward the petition, but the text does indicate that he "cornered" prospective signatories, strongly suggesting that their enthusiasm was neither needed nor considered.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it represents how the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by asserting that the unintended transfer of feelings from one person to another, known as emotional contagion, seems to rely on both people being physically present and able to observe body language. Text 1 then references research that supports this assertion. Text 2 describes an experiment conducted by the researchers Yang and Ferrara in which they found evidence of emotional contagion in the absence of physical interaction, namely through text-based interactions on social media. The researchers in Text 2 wouldn’t completely agree with what is asserted in the underlined portion of Text 1 (that emotional contagion seems to require physical proximity), because their study, which used a social media networking service, found that physical interaction isn’t the only way that emotional contagion can take place. Thus, the researchers in Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by stating that it reflects an incomplete view of emotional contagion, because the phenomenon can occur without an in-person interaction.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the researchers in Text 2 would likely agree that the underlined statement in Text 1 perpetuates a flawed conclusion that emotional contagion requires physical interaction, Text 2 doesn’t address what the researchers thought about smiling as a sign of emotional contagion. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers in Text 2 wouldn’t say that the underlined claim in Text 1 is fairly persuasive. According to Text 2, the researchers conducted a study that found emotional contagion didn’t require physical interaction, because they found evidence of it in text-based online interactions. Choice D is incorrect because neither of the texts claim that emotional contagion primarily occurs when a person is exposed to negativity. Instead, Text 1 claims that physical interaction is required for emotional contagion to occur, and Text 2 describes a study that suggests emotional contagion can occur in text-based online interactions.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to what the researchers mentioned in Text 1 contend. Text 1 discusses the lack of knowledge of how plate tectonics on Earth began. Text 1 also mentions researchers who contend that movements of tectonic plates began around 3 billion years ago. As support for this assertion, these researchers cite computer models (which are simulations, not empirical evidence) of the temperature in Earth’s mantle that show that at that time, the mantle would have been sufficiently molten for plates to move. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that empirical evidence from the geological record is necessary to make plausible claims about when tectonic movement began. Text 2 mentions an analysis performed by Wriju Chowdhury and his team of the geochemistry of zircon crystals (which would constitute empirical evidence). Chowdhury and his team argue, based on this analysis, that tectonic plates may have begun to move as early as 4.2 billion years ago. Therefore, since the author of Text 2 would consider Chowdhury et al.’s empirical evidence to be more conclusive than the computer models cited in Text 1, the author of Text 2 would most likely assert that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 makes no claims about the temperature of Earth’s mantle and therefore wouldn’t argue that the temperature of Earth’s mantle 3 billion years ago was insufficient to allow tectonic movement. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 claims that empirical evidence is needed to fix the earliest date of tectonic movement. Computer models are simulations, not empirical evidence, so the author of Text 2 wouldn’t distinguish between different kinds of computer models but would instead argue that no computer models can reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics. Choice C is incorrect because the author of Text 2 wouldn’t consider any computer model to be able to provide evidence to support a plausible claim about tectonic movement, no matter how much such models were improved. The author of Text 2 would only accept empirical evidence.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The speaker begins by stating that he has heard that others are accusing him of seeking to destroy institutions. The speaker then addresses this criticism by stating that he is “neither for nor against institutions.” Instead, the speaker states that his ultimate goal is to instill “the institution of the dear love of comrades” everywhere in the country. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as an address of criticism followed by an announcement of a grand ambition. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. While the speaker does address an opinion of him that he believes to be untrue, he doesn’t indicate that this attitude has become increasingly prevalent. The speaker also concludes by explaining his goal for the future rather than his current worldview. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t portray the speaker as isolated or regretful, and the speaker gestures toward a hope for societal change but doesn’t offer an explicit prediction that it will happen. Choice C is incorrect because the speaker addresses a criticism of him that he believes to be false; he doesn’t admit any personal shortcomings. Moreover, the speaker concludes by stating a goal he has rather than showcasing his achievements. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the fashion resale market’s continued growth. As used in this context, “predicted” means forecast, or indicated that something would happen in the future. The text indicates that the fashion resale market made a lot of money in 2019 and that some analysts expected the market to continue to grow. This context suggests that the analysts believed that the fashion resale market was going to make more money than it had already made, with the analysts indicating that revenues would more than double by 2028. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that some analysts “produced,” or manufactured or brought about, the increase in future revenues of the fashion resale market. The analysts themselves couldn’t have brought about the future revenue growth, since, as the text suggests, they were merely in the position of drawing conclusions about future fashion resale market revenue based on 2019 revenue. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “denied,” or rejected, this notion. Nothing in the text supports the idea that these analysts thought the revenues wouldn’t grow. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they “worried,” or felt concerned, that revenue would significantly increase by 2028. Nothing in the text suggests that the analysts felt concerned about the increase; rather, the text suggests that the increase would represent a favorable outcome, since it would mean that the fashion resale market grew to generate even more revenue. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how Ofelia Zepeda has contributed to the field of linguistics. As used in this context, “extensive” means having a wide or considerable extent. The text indicates that Zepeda’s many accomplishments in linguistics are varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetry in more than one language, creating a grammar book, and co-founding a language institute. This context supports the idea that Zepeda’s contributions to the field are extensive. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence. It wouldn’t make sense to say that achievements as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions in her field are “pragmatic,” or related to practical matters and not involving intellectual or artistic matters. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence. There’s no reason to believe that the positive achievements listed demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions in her field are “controversial,” or have caused disputes and opposing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “universal” would mean including or covering everything in a group. The sentence presents Zepeda’s accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that these specific achievements—particularly as the author of a grammar book specific to the Tohono O’odham language—demonstrate that Zepeda’s contributions relate to everything in the field of linguistics. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because the text indicates that Fox-Foot doesn’t let the group build a fire or create a canoe landing when it’s time for supper. This context suggests that he doesn’t want anyone who might be following the group to see any sign of them or their activities. In other words, Fox-Foot doesn’t want there to be any trace, or evidence, of the group’s movements ("their passing") through the area.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Fox-Foot doesn’t want the group to be detected, not that he doesn’t want their presence to create a blemish, or a spoiling flaw, in the area; human activity could disturb a natural environment, but the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is instead focused on avoiding giving any sign of the group’s movements through a place ("their passing") to anyone who might be following them. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on Fox-Foot’s desire to avoid detection by those who might be following the group. This context conveys that Fox-Foot doesn’t want to create any signs or evidence of the group moving through a place ("their passing"), not that he doesn’t want to leave behind some quantity of their presence; indeed, it isn’t clear what an amount of a group’s movement would be. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the group has a sketch, or rough drawing, of their movements through that area ("their passing") that might be left behind. Rather, the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is focused on ensuring that the group doesn’t give any kind of
indication of their presence, as he wants to avoid detection by anyone who might be following the group.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of the fossil record from the Cambrian period. In this context, “abrupt” means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reflects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversification, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period. This context establishes that these remains’ entry into the fossil record was sudden. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the word “explosion” appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was “catastrophic,” or disastrous. In context, “explosion” refers to the rapid diversification, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record—a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversification is “elusive,” or difficult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as “imminent,” or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago. </p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Yu’s novel. In this context, “haphazard” means marked by a lack of plan or order. The text indicates that the quest featured in the novel, which involves the protagonist bouncing across time, is chaotic and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen. This context suggests that the protagonist’s journey seems to be marked by a lack of order. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the journey featured in Yu’s novel involves a character “ricocheting chaotically,” or bouncing in a disordered way, across time and causes the reader to often wonder what will happen. It wouldn’t make sense to say that a chaotic journey seems “premeditated,” or characterized by forethought and planning. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t give any indication that readers regard the journey in Yu’s novel as “inspirational,” or as causing extraordinarily creative or brilliant thoughts or actions; instead, the text focuses on the idea that the protagonist’s journey is chaotic, or disordered, and doesn’t give readers a clear sense of what will happen. Choice D is incorrect. Rather than suggesting that the journey featured in Yu’s novel is “fruitless,” or has an unsuccessful outcome, the text focuses on the idea that while reading about the protagonist’s chaotic movements across time, readers are often unsure of what will happen—that is, they don’t know whether the protagonist will be successful in finding his father. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The text tells us that the samples are too "small scale" to reflect the composition of the asteroid, which probably doesn’t show the same variation on a large scale. This suggests that the mineral composition of the samples are unlikely to be exactly the same from sample to sample.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. "Neglected" means "suffering a lack of proper care" or "abandoned," which doesn’t work here. The text never suggests that the distribution of minerals in the samples would be neglected, so this statement doesn’t logically follow. Choice B is incorrect. "Redundant" means "not or no longer useful or needed," which is too strong. The text doesn’t suggest that the variation between the samples isn’t a useful finding at all—just that we can’t assume that the large-scale composition of the asteroid will show the same variation. But the composition of the samples might be useful for something else. Choice C is incorrect. "Ongoing" means "still in progress," which doesn’t make sense: the distribution of minerals in a sample can’t be "ongoing."</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the kinds of mammals alive during the Mesozoic era. As used in this context, “diverse” means to have a significant amount of variety. The text indicates that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals can’t be characterized in a certain way, then contrasts the view put forward by those scientists with Luo’s research, which shows that Mesozoic mammals “weren’t all ground-dwelling insectivores” and instead were “various.” This context suggests that some scientists have viewed Mesozoic mammals as being all alike, or not a very diverse group. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “predatory,” or that they didn’t prey on other animals, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals “weren’t all ground-dwelling insectivores.” This context suggests that some scientists have regarded Mesozoic mammals as all being insectivores, or animals that prey on insects, not that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals didn’t prey on other animals. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “obscure,” or concealed or not well known, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There’s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren’t concealed or well known and the mammals being varied. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that some scientists have suggested that Mesozoic mammals weren’t very “localized,” or confined to a particular area, since the text establishes a contrast between what some scientists have suggested and Luo’s research showing that Mesozoic mammals were a varied group. There’s no contrast between saying that the mammals weren’t localized and the mammals being varied. Although the text mentions mammal fossils found in China, nothing in the discussion of Luo’s research addresses the limits of Mesozoic mammal habitats. </p>

          <p>Jazz tap is a dance form that was first developed in African American communities. Jazz tap was heavily influenced by jazz music, which became widely popular in the United States in the 1920s. Tap dancers were inspired by jazz music’s quick rhythms and by the way jazz musicians would make up melodies as they played. As jazz music continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s, jazz tap evolved with it.

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the main purpose of the text. The text indicates where and when jazz tap first developed (in African American communities in the 1920s) and what influenced it (the quick rhythms and improvisations in jazz music) and then explains that it evolved alongside jazz music in the 1930s and 1940s, resulting in a very different form of tap dance than had existed before. Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to discuss jazz tap’s development.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that jazz music became widely popular in the US in the 1920s and describes some of jazz music’s qualities, the text never explains why audiences prefer some kinds of music—jazz or otherwise—over others. Choice C is incorrect because the text never mentions any musical instruments and doesn’t describe how to play one. Choice D is incorrect because the text discusses jazz tap generally and never identifies a particular dancer, famous or otherwise.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of <em>The Mule Bone</em>, a play that Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes wrote together. In this context, “collaboration” means working together with someone to write a literary work. The text indicates that most writers prefer to work alone and that working together destroyed the friendship between Hurston and Hughes. This establishes that <em>The Mule Bone </em>is a relatively rare example of collaboration in literature. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, “characterization” would mean a literary work’s portrayal of characters’ psychological experiences and motivations, but the text doesn’t discuss characterization in <em>The Mule Bone </em>specifically or in collaborative works more generally. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, “interpretation” would mean the explanation of a literary work’s meaning or significance, but the text doesn’t discuss how readers or critics have interpreted <em>The Mule Bone</em>; instead, the text discusses how the play was written collaboratively and how the writing process affected the two authors. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, “commercialization” would mean writing a literary work in such a way as to ensure its commercial appeal, but the text never discusses commercial appeal as a factor in the writing of <em>The Mule Bone </em>specifically or the writing of collaborative works more generally. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the economist’s claim about sales of personal electronic devices. In this context, “invalidate” most nearly means nullify or make invalid. The text indicates that interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics “have challenged” the economist’s claim that sales of personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the economist’s projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist’s projection entirely—the delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “dispute,” or argue against, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Since the delays are an inanimate circumstance, they couldn’t argue against a prediction about the sales of personal electronics. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to “withdraw,” or remove from consideration, the economist’s projection wouldn’t make sense. Although the economist could withdraw her projection because of the delays, the delays themselves couldn’t withdraw her projection since they’re an inanimate circumstance and thus can’t choose to remove something from consideration. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the delays will “underscore,” or emphasize, the economist’s projection. Instead, the text suggests that the delays are likely to extend the time frame of the economist’s projection but not to undermine the projection entirely. </p>

Though the sentence after the underlined sentence in the text mentions that Ac Ko Mok Ki included information about other tribes on his map, the underlined sentence itself does not address this topic. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence indicates how Ac Ko Mok Ki became interested in mapmaking, only that his mapmaking skills are impressive. Choice D is incorrect because though the underlined sentence describes several features of the map, it does not specifically describe how the map was used.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Francis Cecil Sumner. As used in this context, “proponent of” means supporter of. The text says that Sumner helped to found the psychology department at historically Black Howard University in 1930. This is evidence that Sumner supported increasing the opportunity for Black students to study psychology. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the phrase “supplement to,” or addition to, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text discusses Sumner’s efforts to increase the number of Black psychology students, but it doesn’t make sense to describe him as an addition to his efforts. Choice C is incorrect because Sumner was already an accomplished psychologist himself when he helped to found the Howard University psychology department. While Black students were the beneficiaries of his efforts—that is, they received help because of his efforts—it wouldn’t make sense in this context to describe Sumner as a “beneficiary of” opportunities, because he was the one doing the helping. Choice D is incorrect because founding a psychology department at Howard University wouldn’t be a “distraction for” Sumner’s aim to increase the opportunity for Black students to study psychology—that is, it wouldn’t be something that draws Sumner’s attention away from that goal, but rather the opposite. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion about how, for Schoenemann, a damaged trilobite fossil was informative. In context, “offered” means provided or gave. The text suggests that although it may seem counterintuitive, a broken fossilized trilobite allowed Schoenemann to observe more details of the trilobite’s eye than an intact fossilized trilobite would. This context conveys the idea that a damaged fossil offered, or provided, fresh insight into the structure of a trilobite’s eye. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “resolved” means determined or figured out, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. Although the damaged fossil may have allowed her to determine certain information, as an inanimate object the fossil isn’t capable of resolving anything. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the broken part of a trilobite fossil “adjusted,” or changed or modified, fresh insight wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. This context suggests that the fossil offered fresh insight, or understanding, not that it adjusted fresh insight. Choice D is incorrect because “directed” means managed or instructed, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text focuses on how Schoenemann was able to get more information from a broken fossil than an intact one. This context suggests that the fossil offered fresh insight, or understanding, not that it directed fresh insight. </p>

To investigate the issue, biologist Xingli Giam and colleagues studied an Indonesian oil palm plantation, comparing the species richness of forested streams with that of nonforested streams.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Peter Edwards as a portrait painter. In this context, having a "reputation for" something means that one is widely recognized for being associated with a particular activity. The text indicates that Edwards has created "characteristic works" including "esteemed portraits" of notable figures, suggesting he is known and respected for this type of painting. This choice clearly indicates that Edwards has established recognition or fame specifically in connection with painting portraits of well-known individuals.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Edwards’s portrait painting in a positive manner, describing his works as "esteemed." In this context, "complaint about" would mean dissatisfaction or grievance regarding the activity of painting portraits, which contradicts the positive characterization of Edwards’s work. Nothing in the text suggests that Edwards has expressed any dissatisfaction with or objection to painting portraits of notable figures. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Edwards has a "question about" painting portraits, which in this context would mean uncertainty or doubt regarding this activity. Instead, the text presents Edwards as someone who has already created multiple portrait works described as "characteristic" and "esteemed," suggesting established practice rather than uncertainty. The mention of specific examples of his portrait work further demonstrates that he is not questioning his portrait painting. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not suggest that Edwards has a "requirement for" painting portraits, which in this context would mean a mandatory obligation or necessary condition. Instead, the text indicates that portrait painting is something Edwards is known for doing well, not something he is obligated to do. The text describes his portrait work as "characteristic," suggesting it’s a defining feature of his artistic practice rather than an externally imposed requirement.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The text starts by stating what moral philosophy is concerned with and naming two examples of works in the field. Then it describes a shortcoming of some works in that field (they say how but not why), and finally it states that other works try to avoid that shortcoming (by including both how and why to live a morally good life). </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. This is too extreme. The text never mentions whether the two works are popular or not, and it never argues that these works don’t serve their intended purpose of describing how to live a morally good life. Rather, the text claims that works of moral philosophy that don’t include both how and why to be moral are not useful to readers who don’t already want to be moral. Choice C is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never discusses the history of moral philosophy at all, and it doesn’t propose any topic for further research. Choice D is incorrect. This isn’t the overall structure. The text never discusses which of the two works is more widely read. </p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first sentence presents the general claim that industrial activity is not always a threat to wildlife.

<p>“Oh, Marilla,” she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, “I’m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by noting that Anne “reveled in the world of color about her”—that is, she takes great delight in colorful things. It then relates a scene when she enthusiastically enters the house with autumn foliage and announces that she will decorate her room with it. The focus of the text then shifts to Marilla, who has an undeveloped “aesthetic sense,” or appreciation of beauty, as can be seen when she dismisses the maple leaves as “messy things” and criticizes Anne for cluttering her room with objects from outside. This episode thus illustrates that Anne and Marilla differ in their appreciation of beauty and, more generally, in their basic character: Anne is exuberant and joyful, while Marilla is stern and critical. Therefore, the purpose of the text is to show that Anne and Marilla have very different personalities. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text presents Anne’s appreciation of nature as a basic personality trait, not as a newfound enthusiasm, and never indicates how recently she developed that appreciation. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text portrays Anne and Marilla as having different personalities and attitudes toward natural beauty and home decoration, it doesn’t show them engaging in an argument about this difference or suggest that they often argue about it. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text does indicate that Marilla disapproves of how Anne plans to decorate her room, Marilla’s disapproval is a supporting detail that serves to develop her personality, which the text as a whole contrasts with Anne’s personality. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of solar energy collection and storage. In this context, "fluctuations in" means irregular changes in. The text notes that economists recommend that countries that want to rely more on solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) should attempt to expand their storage capacity. The text goes on to explain that having a large amount of stored solar energy can lessen the negative effect of "unpredictable shifts in cloud cover and haze"—that is, unpredictable changes in environmental conditions that at times limit sunlight. This context suggests that having ample solar energy stored and ready to use can mitigate the issue of fluctuations in solar energy collection caused by irregular patterns of sunlight availability.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "developments of solar energy collection" would most clearly refer to the creation of ways to collect solar energy (energy captured from sunlight). The text focuses on collection and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight ("cloud cover and haze"); there’s no reason to think that the creation of new collection methods would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "calibrations with" would most clearly refer to precise adjustments for a particular purpose. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight ("cloud cover and haze"); there’s no reason to think that precision in something related to solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated. Choice D is incorrect. The text focuses on the collection of solar energy (energy captured from sunlight) and the idea that having stored energy can mitigate, or make less bad, the effects of a problem caused by unpredictable changes that affect sunlight ("cloud cover and haze"); nothing in the text suggests that "incentives for," or rewards for, solar energy collection would be viewed as a problem that would need to be mitigated, especially in countries that want to rely more on solar energy than they already do.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of single-celled organism behavior. As used in this context, “rudimentary” means basic or unsophisticated. According to the text, a study of the single-celled protozoan <em>Stentor roeseli</em> showed that the organisms can switch strategies for escaping certain stimuli, “sophisticatedly ‘changing their minds’” and using new strategies should other strategies fail. This context suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic or rudimentary, since the study showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “aggressive,” or threatening. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of <em>Stentor roeseli</em> showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “evolving,” or advancing. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of <em>Stentor roeseli</em> showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behavior that is “advantageous,” or helpful. Rather, the text suggests that single-celled organisms may not be limited to behaviors that are basic, since the study of <em>Stentor roeseli</em> showed that single-celled protozoans can respond complexly to irritating stimuli. </p>

<p style="padding-left: 1em;">[Atlante] gave this letter to Charlot; who immediately ran into the balcony with it, where she still found Rinaldo in a melancholy posture, leaning his head on his hand: She showed him the letter, but was afraid to toss it to him, for fear it might fall to the ground; so he ran and fetched a long cane, which he cleft at one end, and held it while she put the letter into the cleft, and stayed not to hear what he said to it. But never was man so transported with joy, as he was at the reading of this letter; it gives him new wounds; for to the generous, nothing obliges love so much as love.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The narrator begins by explaining how Charlot carefully delivers Atlante’s letter to Rinaldo, and then relates that Rinaldo feels “transported with joy” after reading the letter. Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character’s happiness after reading the letter. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there’s no explanation why another character hasn’t written one. In addition, the text’s description of Rinaldo “in a melancholy posture” suggests that he’s sad and thoughtful, not that he’s desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text states that Charlot won’t toss the letter to Rinaldo because she doesn’t want it to fall, the text doesn’t refer to the contents of the letter. Instead, the text describes how happy Rinaldo feels after reading it. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does describe Rinaldo’s reaction to the letter, the text doesn’t begin by discussing Atlante’s inspiration for writing the letter. Instead, the text begins by discussing the delivery of the letter. </p>

<p>In a study of insect behavior, Samadi Galpayage and colleagues presented bumblebees with small wooden balls and observed many of the bees clinging to, rolling, and dragging the objects. The researchers provided no external rewards (such as food) to encourage these interactions. <u>The bees simply appeared to be playing—and for no other reason than because they were having fun</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>
<p>Insects do not have cortexes or other brain areas associated with emotions in humans. Still, Galpayage and her team have shown that bumblebees may engage in play, possibly experiencing some kind of positive emotional state.

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. The author of Text 2 agrees with the author of Text 1 that bumblebees may engage in play and possibly experience some kind of positive emotional state. However, the author of Text 2 also qualifies this claim by stating that emotions in insects, if they do exist, are “likely very rudimentary.” </p><p>Choice A is incorrect.

The author of Text 2 states that if insects do feel emotions, those emotions are “likely very rudimentary.” Choice C is incorrect. The author of Text 2 does not compare or contrast the behavior or emotions of insects and humans, and neither does the author of Text 1. </p>

<p>Many studies in psychology have shown that people seek out information even when they know in advance that they have no immediate use for it and that they won’t directly benefit from it. Such findings support the consensus view among researchers of curiosity: namely, that curiosity is not instrumental but instead represents a drive to acquire information for its own sake.</p>
<p>Text 2</p>
<p>While acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, Rachit Dubey and colleagues ran an experiment to test whether emphasizing the usefulness of scientific information could increase curiosity about it. They found that when research involving rats and fruit flies was presented as having medical applications for humans, participants expressed greater interest in learning about it than when the research was not presented as useful.</p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer. The researchers in Text 2 recognize that acquiring information is a powerful motivator, but showed that this motivation can still be affected by other factors, like whether or not the information is expected to be useful or not. This suggests that other desires may play a part in driving people to acquire information. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. The consensus view in Text 1 is that people acquire information regardless of whether they think they can use it later. Dubey and colleagues acknowledge this fact (so they don’t claim people seek out information “only” because it might be useful later). Choice C is incorrect. This choice misreads the results of Dubey and colleagues’ study in Text 2. Neither text discusses the difficulty of determining the motivation for information-seeking. Choice D is incorrect. This choice contradicts Text 2, which starts with Dubey and colleagues “acknowledging that acquiring information is a powerful motivator” (i.e., agreeing that curiosity explains the seeking of apparently purposeless information). The research in Text 2 simply suggests that more than just curiosity can motivate information-seeking behavior when the information has a purpose. </p>

<p>Conventional wisdom long held that human social systems evolved in stages, beginning with hunter-gatherers forming small bands of members with roughly equal status. The shift to agriculture about 12,000 years ago sparked population growth that led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical structures: associations of clans first, then chiefdoms, and finally, bureaucratic states.</p>

<p>In a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans have always been socially flexible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with decentralized leadership. The authors point to evidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some hunter-gatherers adjusted their social structures seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but also assembling into communities that included esteemed individuals.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it describes the most likely way that Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) would respond to the “conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1. According to Text 1, the conventional wisdom about human social systems is that they developed through stages, beginning with hunter-gatherer bands, then moving to clan associations, then chiefdoms, and finally arriving at states with bureaucratic structures. Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow believe that human social systems have been flexible, shifting between different types of structures, including both hierarchical and collective systems, and that these shifts may have even occurred seasonally. This suggests that Graeber and Wengrow would dispute the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that Graeber and Wengrow believe that decentralized collective societies are more significant than hierarchical systems. Text 2 is focused on Graeber and Wengrow’s view that humans have flexibly shifted among various social structures, not on the importance of particular structures relative to others. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t include any information suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow believe that hierarchies didn’t emerge until after the rise of agriculture. In fact, Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow cite evidence suggesting that some hunter-gatherer groups formed social structures with hierarchical elements (“communities that included esteemed individuals”) 50,000 years ago, long before the rise of agriculture, which Text 1 says occurred around 12,000 years ago. Choice D is incorrect because there’s no information in Text 2 suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow would challenge the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure. Although Text 1 does indicate that hunter-gatherer groups are assumed to be the earliest human social system, Text 2 says only that Graeber and Wengrow believe that some hunter-gatherer groups made use of different social structures at different times. Text 2 doesn’t imply that Graeber and Wengrow doubt that hunter-gatherer groups preceded most other social structures. </p>

          <p>Text 1</p>
<p>The fossil record suggests that mammoths went extinct around 11 thousand years (kyr) ago. In a 2021 study of environmental DNA (eDNA)—genetic material shed into the environment by organisms—in the Arctic, Yucheng Wang and colleagues found mammoth eDNA in sedimentary layers formed millennia later, around 4 kyr ago. To account for this discrepancy, Joshua H. Miller and Carl Simpson proposed that arctic temperatures could preserve a mammoth carcass on the surface, allowing it to leach DNA into the environment, for several thousand years.</p>
<p>Text 2</p>
<p>Wang and colleagues concede that eDNA contains DNA from both living organisms and carcasses, but for DNA to leach from remains over several millennia requires that the remains be perpetually on the surface. Scavengers and weathering in the Arctic, however, are likely to break down surface remains well before a thousand years have passed.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. Text 1 introduces Wang and colleagues’ study and its surprising results, and then mentions Miller and Simpson’s hypothesis as a possible way to explain them. Text 2, however, challenges Miller and Simpson’s hypothesis by pointing out the difficulties of preserving mammoth carcasses on the surface for thousands of years: “scavengers and weathering” are the additional details that complicate the Miller/Simpson hypothesis. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Neither text compares two different approaches for studying mammoth extinction. Text 1 describes one study and one hypothesis pertaining to it. Text 2 critiques that hypothesis. Choice C is incorrect. Text 1 does not describe a critique of Wang and colleagues’ methodology, but rather an interpretation of their results by Miller and Simpson. Text 2 does not offer additional details showing that methodology to be sound, but rather casts doubt on the Miller/Simpson explanation. Choice D is incorrect. Both components mentioned here (the new “undermining” research and the theory for reconciling this discovery) are contained in Text 1. Text 2 then shows how the attempt to reconcile the standard view and new research is flawed, and still fails to explain the discrepancy. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "Exposure to" means "having contact with." It makes sense that Prasad and Bainbridge were investigating whether seeing false versions of images was a cause of false visual memories. Notice how "exposure to incorrect renditions" matches the idea of "familiarity with erroneous versions," which appears later in the sentence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. "Compliance with" means "going along with a command or directive." False versions of images can’t give commands or directives, so this doesn’t apply. Choice C is incorrect. "Criteria" means "standards by which to judge something." It’s not clear how people would come to have standards for the wrong version of an image in the first place, let alone how those standards would cause them to falsely remember the correct version. In other words, this choice would result in a confusing, unclear sentence. Choice D is incorrect. "Forfeiture of" means "a giving up of something." It wouldn’t make sense to say that false memories of an image might be caused by giving up the wrong version of the image.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of programs that encourage money to cycle within a community. In this context, "instituting" means initiating. The text indicates that making purchases at small local businesses can help keep money cycling within a community. The text goes on to state that some cities are establishing incentives to promote small business shopping. This context supports the idea that some cities are instituting programs to encourage this consumer behavior.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because saying that some cities are "occupying," or forcibly holding possession or control of, programs that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses wouldn’t make sense in context. The text doesn’t discuss who controls these programs but instead indicates that some cities are establishing incentives that encourage shoppers to make purchases at small local businesses. Furthermore, it wouldn’t make sense to say that a city is occupying a program. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that cities are "underestimating," or failing to understand the value of, programs that encourage consumers to shop at small local businesses. The text indicates that some cities are establishing incentives to encourage small business shopping, which suggests that these cities understand the value of such programs. Choice D is incorrect because saying that some cities are "encountering," or coming into contact with, programs that encourage consumers to shop at small local businesses wouldn’t make sense in context. The text indicates that some cities are already establishing incentives to encourage shoppers to make purchases at small businesses. This context suggests that the cities are instituting the programs, not that they are encountering them.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the method the inhabitants of the Mexica empire used to track time. In this context, "exactitude" means precision. The text indicates that the Mexica used the sun’s position relative to various natural landmarks to track the passage of time, explaining that such methods allowed the Mexica to accurately determine the dates of important events such as solstices. This context supports the idea that the Mexica people were able to track time with a high degree of precision, or exactitude.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context "precariousness" would mean instability, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the method used by the Mexica people to track time was unstable or produced unstable results. Rather, the text indicates that the method yielded precise results, allowing the Mexica to accurately determine the dates of significant events. Choice C is incorrect because in this context "resilience" would mean persistence, and there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the Mexica worked stubbornly in spite of obstacles in order to track time.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it best describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. According to the text, it was hard for Yamauchi to adapt her short story into the play <em>And the Soul Shall Dance</em> because the story had included little dialogue, instead describing the characters’ silent thoughts. The underlined sentence offers information about how Yamauchi ultimately succeeded in adapting the story into a play: it explains that Yamauchi created situations where the characters of the play could reveal their internal thoughts while speaking with each other.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole makes any mention of playwrights other than Yamauchi or how the play might have influenced them. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that Yamauchi is best known for her play <em>And the Soul Shall Dance</em>, which conveys that the play is better known than the short story it’s based on is. Choice D is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole mentions the actors who performed in the play or Yamauchi’s approach to choosing them.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. In the first sentence of the text, the narrator states that she thinks there’s a chance she will become part of the basketball team at her college. She goes on to explain that she is "quick" and "tough." Based on these characteristics, she thinks she has a chance to join the team. Thus, the main purpose of the text is to explain why the narrator thinks she might make the basketball team.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses solely on basketball and doesn’t mention any other kinds of sports. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe aspects of the game of basketball. Instead, it provides the narrator’s reasoning for thinking that she might make her school basketball team. Choice C is incorrect. Although the narrator explains why she thinks she will be chosen for the basketball team at her school, the text doesn’t go into the general decision-making process or the requirements for being picked for the team.</p>

<p>Although food writing is one of the most widely read genres in the United States, literary scholars have long neglected it. And within this genre, cookbooks attract the least scholarly attention of all, regardless of how well written they may be. This is especially true of works dedicated to regional US cuisines, whose complexity and historical significance are often overlooked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span aria-level="2" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>With her 1976 cookbook <em>The Taste of Country Cooking</em>, Edna Lewis popularized the refined Southern cooking she had grown up with in Freetown, an all-Black community in Virginia. She also set a new standard for cookbook writing: the recipes and memoir passages interspersing them are written in prose more elegant than that of most novels. <span aria-label="Referenced Content" role="region"><u>Yet despite its inarguable value as a piece of writing, Lewis’s masterpiece has received almost no attention from literary scholars.</u></span></p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. Text 1 states that literary scholars ignore regional cookbooks most of all, even when they have historical significance and are well written. So the author of Text 1 wouldn’t be surprised that scholars ignored Edna Lewis’s cookbook. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never suggests that scholars are dismissive of popular works in general. Instead, Text 1 says that scholars ignore food writing specifically, despite its popularity—and despite the fact that it can be historically significant and complex. Choice C is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never suggests that elements of other genres should be kept out of cookbooks. Choice D is incorrect. We can’t infer that this is how the author of Text 1 would regard the situation. Text 1 never discusses how food writing is or should be marketed. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of political blogs. In this context, "sanguine" means optimistic. The text begins by noting the rise of political blogs with readily identifiable ideological alignments in the early 2000s. The text then indicates that some commentators saw this as a positive development, citing a reason why (their difference from traditional news). Finally, the text goes on to contrast those commentators with others who have a negative opinion of the rise of political blogs (because they increase political polarization among their readers). This context supports the idea that the second group of commentators is less positive than the first: thus, the second group of commentators is less optimistic, or sanguine.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it would not make sense in this context to describe those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs as less "recalcitrant," or obstinately uncooperative, than those commentators who supported political blogs. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs are less "misanthropic," or less contemptuous of humankind, than those commentators who have a positive opinion of political blogs—there is no indication in the text that those commentators who like political blogs would be contemptuous of humankind at all. Choice D is incorrect because there is no evidence that those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs are less "earnest," or sincere, than those who have a positive opinion of such blogs—presumably, both groups of commentators hold their beliefs with equal conviction.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, "rough" most nearly means harsh, or forceful and unpleasant. The text describes Mary’s surroundings as she plays: the sun is out and there’s "a little wind." To further illustrate the wind, the narrator contrasts the word "rough" with a description of the wind blowing in "delightful little gusts," suggesting that the wind is not unpleasant or harsh at all.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts "rough" objects, or objects with irregular surfaces, can sometimes be scratchy, rough doesn’t mean scratchy in this context. The text explains that the wind is not rough but rather gentle, "delightful little gusts," which suggests that the use of "rough" here is referring to the degree of force of the wind. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that the wind wasn’t "basic," or simple and uncomplicated. Instead, the text describes the wind as blowing not roughly or harshly but in "delightful little gusts." Choice D is incorrect because the word "vague" means not clearly expressed or seen. Nothing in the text indicates that the wind was barely noticeable to Mary as she played outside, but rather the text states that it was delightful.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, a span of time is described as "a void" space, which most nearly means an empty or vacant one. In the text, the speaker describes summertime in counterintuitive terms: although nature’s "surging life is at its full" during the season, the speaker feels summer to be "a time of pause, / A void and silent space between two worlds." The speaker says further that during summer, "feeling sleeps / Gathering strength" for future efforts. Thus, the speaker regards summer as an empty stretch of time, to be followed by a period of greater activity.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text does present summer as a time of inactivity, it doesn’t characterize that inactivity as useless, or as having no purpose; in fact, the speaker regards summer as a time when "feeling" gathers "strength for efforts yet to come." Choice C is incorrect. Although the text characterizes summer as a time "when inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps," it doesn’t discuss the season’s relationship to the speaker’s memory or suggest that summer can easily be forgotten. Choice D is incorrect. In some contexts, "void" can mean devoid of, or lacking, a particular element, and such a lack could be conceived of as incompleteness. However, the text doesn’t portray summer as not being complete or whole; instead, it characterizes vacancy or inactivity as being an essential quality of the season, as experienced by the speaker.</p>

Throughout the text, the speaker characterizes nighttime as if it were a person who wears clothing (“a garment” that is “velvet soft” and “violet blue”) and a veil “over her face” and who moves her hands “slowly with their gem-starred light” through her dark hair.

As used in this context, “atypical” would mean unrepresentative or not common. The text indicates that Wong is one of “nearly a dozen” characters in Delany’s novels who are poets or writers. This context conveys that being a poet isn’t an atypical occupation for a character in one of Delany’s works.  </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because “infallible” means to be accurate or without fault, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers. This context suggests that the occupation isn’t atypical for Delany, not that the occupation isn’t infallible, or problematic. Choice C is incorrect because “lucrative” means to be profitable, which wouldn’t make sense in context. If writing poet characters weren’t profitable, it wouldn’t be logical to explain this by citing that Delany gave many of his characters the same occupation. Choice D is incorrect because “tedious” means to be boring, which wouldn’t make sense in context. The text focuses on the fact that Delany has written many characters who are poets and writers. This context suggests that the occupation isn’t atypical for Delany, not that the occupation isn’t tedious. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Yaszek’s introduction to her science fiction anthology. In this context "overtly" means openly or without concealment. The text draws a contrast between the lack of "deliberately signaled" political themes in woman-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s. This contrast implies that the work from the 1970s did clearly reflect feminist political themes. In other words, the text indicates that unlike women who wrote science fiction in the 1920s to the 1960s, the women who wrote science fiction in the 1970s expressed overtly feminist themes.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context "prudently" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science fiction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context "cordially" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a significant factor for women writing science fiction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s. The text draws a contrast between the lack of "deliberately signaled" political themes in woman-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s. It’s unclear how "less deliberately signaled" politics and an increasing sense of politeness toward feminism would constitute a meaningful contrast. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "inadvertently" would mean unintentionally, and nothing in the text suggests that Yaszek thought the feminist elements of the woman-authored science fiction from the 1970s arose without deliberate effort.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how kelp forests help marine animals. In this context, "tranquil" means free from disturbance, or calm. The text indicates that ocean currents are powerful and make it difficult for marine animals to hide from predators and that kelp forests slow currents down to create calmer areas. In other words, kelp forests create a more tranquil environment.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that kelp forests provide shelter for marine animals, meaning they create environments that are safer, not more "dangerous." Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how kelp forests affect currents in the ocean, and it isn’t clear how an ocean environment could be "imaginative," or full of imagination. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that kelp forests create a calm and safe environment, and an environment that is "surprising" would be characterized by unexpected occurrences, not calmness.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the factors that influence peoples’ decisions to move to a different state. As used in this context, “overshadowed by” means to be surpassed by or caused to seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to be more important than state taxes. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren’t as important a consideration as other factors when people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn’t suggest that state taxes are “consistent with,” or in agreement with these other factors. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “representative of,” or typical of, other factors. Taxes aren’t an example of employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate, which are the other factors listed in the text. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to say that state taxes are “irrelevant to,” or unconnected or unimportant to other factors. State taxes are irrelevant to peoples’ decisions, not to other factors. In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable to have an opinion about state taxes. Furthermore, the text indicates that significant differences in state taxes have almost no effect on peoples’ choices to move, but they aren’t completely unimportant. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text begins by stating that the new picture “failed to fit in” with the other items that the shop owner has. The text goes on to illustrate that point by describing the other pictures the shop owner has, indicating that the shop owner is fuming because he doesn’t think the new picture belongs in the store. In the second paragraph, however, the text indicates that the shop owner is “secretly proud of his acquisition.” The main purpose of the text is thus to reveal the shop owner’s conflicted feelings about the new picture. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that the shop owner resents the young man who sold him the new picture; in fact, the text gives no indication of the owner’s feelings about the young man at all. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there’s no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any other items. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe what the new picture looks like; rather, the text identifies some of the other kinds of images that the shop owner has and states that they’re different from the new picture without explaining how they’re different. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega’s assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn’t attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe—nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn’t go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.</p>

In this context, "influenced" means to have had an effect on something’s development. The text indicates that there is a connection between Thomas’s work and the flowers and trees in her home’s garden, giving the example of Thomas’s brushstrokes being inspired by light shining through the leaves of a tree in front of her house.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer. "Defied" means "resisted" or "deliberately disobeyed," which matches the way Klein broke from the conventions of photography in his time by including features that were generally seen as flaws.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. "Reviewed" means "analyzed" or "evaluated," but that doesn’t really fit the context here. Klein isn’t directly providing any thoughtful examination of the conventions of photography: he’s just breaking all the rules. Choice C is incorrect. "Respected" can mean "admired" or "followed" (as in the case of conventions). It’s clear that Klein didn’t respect conventions, given his use of photographic features that were generally considered "flaws." Choice D is incorrect. "Prevented" means "stopped," and Klein did not stop the conventions—they still existed. Instead, he made images that were seen as "flawed" under those conventions.</p>

For her album <em>Orchestral Powwow</em>, Derksen composed new songs in the style of traditional powwow music that were accompanied by classical arrangements played by an orchestra.

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to discuss how Derksen’s compositions incorporate elements from both Indigenous and classical music. After introducing Derksen, the text describes how the songs Derksen composed for her album <em>Orchestral Powwow</em> feature aspects of the two musical traditions. Specifically, the text notes that Derksen wrote songs in the style of traditional powwow music but accompanied them with classical arrangements played by an orchestra that followed the beat of a powwow drum rather than the directions of a conductor. In this way, Derksen’s compositions blend different cultures. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because although the text suggests that Derksen’s songs contain innovative elements since they blend styles from two different musical traditions, it doesn’t discuss whether her compositions constitute a new style of music, let alone whether Derksen should be recognized for creating a new style of music. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any difficulties Derksen encountered when producing her album. Rather, the text describes how the songs on the album exemplify how Derksen combines music from two different cultures.
 Choice D is incorrect because although the text mentions Derksen’s Cree heritage and suggests that she relies on knowledge of both Indigenous and classical music when she composes her songs, it doesn’t discuss her musical training. Additionally, the text is primarily focused on how Derksen combines different cultural traditions, not on contrasting Derksen’s training with her heritage. </p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the archaeologists’ study of the ancient amphitheater in Switzerland. In this context, “provide” means make available or supply. The text states that the archaeologists believe that the amphitheater dates to the fourth century CE. The text goes on to say that the archaeologists discovered a coin made between 337 and 341 CE (that is, made during the fourth century CE) and building materials appropriate to the era in question. This context suggests that these discoveries provide evidence for the archaeologists’ theory about the dating of the amphitheater. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the archaeologists’ discoveries are presented as supplying evidence in favor of their theory about the dating of the amphitheater, not something that would “dismiss,” or reject serious consideration of, evidence for that theory. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the archaeologists’ discoveries would “regulate,” or govern or bring order to, evidence for the archaeologists’ theory about the dating of the amphitheater. The discoveries are presented as supplying evidence for the archaeologists’ theory, not as changing how evidence for the theory is controlled or ordered. Choice D is incorrect because the archaeologists’ discoveries are presented as supplying evidence in favor of their theory about the dating of the amphitheater, not something that would “refuse,” or be unwilling to accept, evidence for the archaeologists’ theory. </p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text’s discussion of Jeyifous’s series of images for the 2020 exhibition. In this context, “created” means produced. The text explains that Jeyifous, a photographer and neurobiologist, photographed adults who had appeared as children in posters from the 1970s, then combined those photographs with magnified images of the adults’ cells—a process that resulted in what he called “micro and macro portraiture.” This context suggests that Jeyifous drew on his dual interests in photography and neurobiology to produce the images for display in the exhibition. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jeyifous “validated,” or corroborated, the series of images. The text describes Jeyifous’s process for composing the images but doesn’t describe Jeyifous making an effort to evaluate the images for their artistic or scientific legitimacy. Choice C is incorrect because there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Jeyifous “challenged,” or disputed, an aspect of the images; rather, the focus of the text is on the inspiration behind the images and the method Jeyifous used to achieve them. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that Jeyifous made the images himself using a combination of photography and magnified pictures of cells, not that he “restored,” or reconditioned, the images from a deteriorated state. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of an exhibit at the Brooklyn Public Library. In this context, "overlook" means to ignore or to miss. The text states that artist and curator Joe Baker organized an exhibit that features Lenape beadwork in historical and modern works. The text describes the exhibit as "essential viewing," suggesting that it’s an important exhibit that people should make an effort to visit; this context conveys that it would be a mistake to overlook the exhibit.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "complicate" would mean to add difficulty, and there’s no reason to think the text would need to directly caution against complicating Baker’s exhibit; the text focuses on the idea that the exhibit is "essential viewing," not on the idea of a potential difficulty that could be raised. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, "amplify" means to increase, and there’s no reason to believe the text would indicate that it would be a mistake to increase an exhibit the text describes as "essential viewing." Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that it would be a mistake to "assemble," or put together, Baker’s exhibit: the text makes it clear that the exhibit has already been put together and, further, praises the exhibit as "essential viewing."</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Benjamin Franklin’s popularity in France. In this context, "esteem" means high regard. The text indicates that Franklin was very popular, or highly regarded, in France, where he sought the country’s support for the United States in its fight for independence, and indicates that his status helped him achieve his goal. The context therefore suggests that being held in high regard by the people likely helped Franklin convince France to help the United States.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text directly indicates that it was Franklin’s popularity that likely helped him convince France to help the United States, not his "thoughtfulness" (which in this context would mean either his careful reasoning and attention or his kind consideration of others’ needs). Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that there was any "controversy," or dispute, about Franklin’s presence in France; instead, the text states that Franklin was very popular in France and directly indicates that this status likely helped him convince France to help the United States. Choice D is incorrect because the text directly indicates that it was Franklin’s popularity that likely helped him convince France to help the United States, not his "sincerity," or his honesty.</p>

          <p><strong>Text 1</strong></p>
<p>Some animal species, like the leopard, can be found in many kinds of areas. On the other hand, tropical mountain bird species tend to be limited in the types of spaces they can call home. This is because many mountain bird species are only able to survive at very specific elevations. Over time, these species have likely become used to living at a specific temperature. Therefore, these species struggle to survive at elevations that are warmer or colder than they are used to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>
<p>A new study reviewed observations of nearly 3,000 bird species to understand why tropical mountain bird species live at specific elevations. They noted that when a mountain bird species was found in an area with many other bird species, it tended to inhabit much smaller geographic areas. It is thus likely that competition for resources with other species, not temperature, limits where these birds can live.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. Both texts state that tropical mountain bird species have limited ranges or habitats, although they disagree on the reason for this. Text 1 claims that temperature is the main factor that determines where these birds can live, while Text 2 claims that competition with other species is the main factor. However, both texts agree that these birds are not able to survive in many kinds of areas. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Neither text mentions the tools or methods that scientists use to observe these birds, either now or in the past. Choice C is incorrect. Neither text mentions anything about how these birds build their nests. Choice D is incorrect. Neither text provides any information about the genetic similarity of these birds, so we have no evidence that either author would agree with this statement. </p>

          <p>Part of the Atacama Desert in Peru has surprisingly rich plant life despite receiving almost no rainfall.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The first two sentences establish a natural phenomenon: there is a richness of plant life found in the Atacama Desert despite the hard soil that makes it challenging for seeds to germinate. The next sentence, which contains the underlined portion, offers a potential explanation for the phenomenon: local birds dig ground nests exposing seeds to moisture and materials in the soil necessary for germination. The last sentence summarizes a study that compared the fertileness of mounds of dirt dug up by birds to mounds that were undisturbed to support the explanation in the underlined portion. Thus, the underlined portion mainly functions to explain how certain birds promote seed germination in the Atacama Desert soil. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address the topic of the soil’s tough crust or its formation. Instead, the text elaborates on the idea that local birds that build ground nests may help seeds germinate in the hard soil. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion describes how some birds may support seed germination in Atacama Desert soil but doesn’t describe how the seeds are deposited into the soil before germination begins.  Choice C is incorrect because neither the underlined portion nor the text as a whole identifies a reason that a particular bird species may choose to dig ground nests in the Atacama Desert soil. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, "specific" most nearly means particular. The text is referring to the particular view of the Port of Oakland as seen from a subway train as it rises from underground. This specific, or particular, view has always been special to Moss, a lifetime resident of West Oakland.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text itself is a work of fiction, the view is something Moss can point out to his companions on the train, so the view itself is presumably not imaginary. Choice B is incorrect. Although this view of the Port of Oakland is significant to Moss, nothing in the text describes the view as particularly energetic as opposed to calming, for example. Choice C is incorrect. The point of the text is that the view of the Port of Oakland from the subway train as it rises from underground is significant to Moss, not whether it is described as being correct, which the text does not address.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Bastos’s study of a wild kea parrot. In this context, "accidental" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos’s study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos’s findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos’s findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics’ opinion regarding the kea’s use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea’s use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics’ opinion in this context must be that the kea’s use of stones was unintentional, or accidental.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos’s claim that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea’s usage of stones "intriguing," or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea’s stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea’s usage of small stones was "obvious," or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea’s usage of small stones was "observable," or visible, this would not conflict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea’s usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.</p>

<p>American sculptor Edmonia Lewis is best known for her sculptures that represent figures from history and mythology, such as <em>The Death of Cleopatra</em> and <em>Haga</em>r. Although Lewis sculpted other subjects, her career as a sculptor is best represented by the works in which she depicted these historical and mythical themes. </p>

<p><strong>Text 2 </strong></p>
<p>Art historians have typically ignored the many portrait busts Edmonia Lewis created. Lewis likely carved these busts (sculptures of a person’s head) frequently throughout her long career. She is known for her sculptures that represent historical figures, but Lewis likely supported herself financially by carving portrait busts for acquaintances who paid her to represent their features.

        <p>Choice D is the best answer. Author 1 acknowledges that Lewis sculpted other subjects besides historical and mythical figures, suggesting a variety of subjects depicted. Author 2 mentions that Lewis carved portrait busts as well as historical sculptures, which also implies variation among Lewis’s subjects. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Neither text suggests that Lewis’s portrait busts have received more attention or appreciation than her other work.

Neither text explicitly states that <em>The Death of Cleopatra</em> is Lewis’s most famous piece. Author 1 mentions it as one example of her historical works, but does not single it out as being more important or influential than <em>Hagar</em>. Author 2 does not mention it at all, focusing instead on her portrait busts. Choice C is incorrect. This choice isn’t supported by the texts.

        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to portray Francie’s determination to reach her goal of reading all the books in the world. The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, finishing one book per day over a long period of time. The text then suggests that even though she progresses slowly ("she was still in the B’s") and that she struggled with some books ("some of the B’s had been hard going"), she doesn’t give up because she thinks of herself as "a reader." These details show Francie’s resolve.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) that Francie has read about, it doesn’t indicate that any of these topics are unusual or that she especially enjoyed reading about one of these topics in particular. If anything, the text suggests that she may have found some of these topics to be dull, saying that she even read the "dry ones"—that is, the boring books—and that some of the books were "hard going," meaning they were difficult to get through. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t discuss Francie’s involvement in other activities, only her dedication to reading. Although it’s possible that Francie dedicates herself to reading because she prefers it to other activities, the text doesn’t indicate whether this is the case. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text mentions one author (Abbott) whose book Francie has read as well as several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) she has encountered, the text doesn’t say whether Francie admires any of the books she’s read so far. Instead, the text focuses on the time and effort she devotes to reaching her goal of reading all the books in the world—even ones she doesn’t enjoy.</p>

The first sentence of the text introduces literary scholar Jeremy Douglass’s warning to technology investors and enthusiasts against predicting the displacement of conventional books by newer media forms. The next sentence, which is underlined in part, presents Douglass’s observation that interactive texts are hardly new; they have been available for longer than technologists assume, beginning with the first time readers wrote notes in texts’ margins. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to challenge the stance of the technology investors and enthusiasts mentioned earlier in the text. As the remainder of the text points out, newer media doesn’t necessarily replace older media, but rather, as Douglass believes, leads to new forms of expression.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion challenges the position taken by investors and enthusiasts; it doesn’t provide context for their claims. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t mention academics or compare them to investors regarding their ability to see potential in using contemporary interactive texts; instead, the underlined portion challenges the position of investors and enthusiasts who predict that conventional books will be replaced by newer forms of media. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn’t address technological challenges; instead, it disputes the stance taken by investors and enthusiasts, suggesting that conventional books haven’t been displaced by traditional interactions with texts, such as writing in the margins, and won’t be supplanted by newer forms of media either.</p>

<p>Ecologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources. According to <span aria-label="Referenced Content" role="region"><u>conventional wisdom</u></span>, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists’ many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t uncovered a satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p> </p><p><span aria-level="2" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Ecologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton’s diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld’s team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.</p>
          <p>Based on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1? </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because based on Text 2, it represents how Behrenfeld and colleagues would most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1. The conventional wisdom cited holds the opinion that when there is species diversity within a phytoplankton population, “one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest”—that is, after being so successful in competing for resources that the other species vanish from the population. However, Text 2 explains that according to Behrenfeld and colleagues, phytoplankton are so small and spaced so far apart in the water that there is “much less” direct competition for resources within phytoplankton populations than scientists had previously thought. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses whether routine replenishment of ocean nutrients affects competition between phytoplankton species. Choice C is incorrect because the interspecies competition discussed in both texts is specifically between phytoplankton species, and neither text considers whether phytoplankton compete for resources with larger nonphytoplankton species. Choice D is incorrect because according to Text 2, Behrenfeld and colleagues argue that water density decreases, not increases, competition between phytoplankton species. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, “simply” most nearly means easily, or involving minimal difficulty or effort. The text first provides Alice’s reflections on her plan to gain access to a garden and then offers commentary on her plan by the novel’s narrator. The text indicates that a reason Alice likes her plan despite not being fully thought through is that she nonetheless believes it can be efficiently arranged. In other words, the text indicates that one of the supposed benefits of Alice’s plan is that it can be easily arranged. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Alice’s plan can be arranged, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that it can be arranged “faintly,” or with little strength or not strongly. Instead, the text indicates that the plan can be arranged with little difficulty. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean quickly, hastily, or hurriedly, the word “hastily” indicates that something is done too quickly. Although it may be true that Alice’s plan was made in haste, the text doesn’t focus on this aspect of her plan. Instead, the text focuses on the plan’s seemingly good qualities, saying that Alice thinks of it as “the best,” and the narrator refers to it as “excellent” and “neatly,” or efficiently, arranged. Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts “simply” can mean foolishly, or lacking good sense, it doesn’t have this meaning in this context. Although the text says that Alice doesn’t know how to go about her plan, it begins by presenting her plan in a positive light: Alice describes her plan as “the best,” and the narrator refers to the plan as “excellent” and “neatly,” or efficiently, arranged. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the function of the third sentence within the overall structure of the text. The third sentence makes a generalization, asserting that evolutionary links between predators and prey can persist across great expanses of time and distance. This generalization is exemplified by the text’s discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and <em>B. terrenus</em> beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no <em>B. terrenus</em> beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted. When the beetles were introduced to North America more than 200 years later, however, they quickly attacked mimosa trees, illustrating the generalization that links between predators and prey "can persist across centuries and continents."</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t indicate that Chang and colleagues were investigating any hypothesis. According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area. Choice C is incorrect because the third sentence doesn’t discuss any particular species, let alone the species mentioned elsewhere in the text, nor does the sentence explain why species spread to new locations. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence offers a generalization about the relationship between predators and prey, not an explanation for the findings by Chang and colleagues that’s an "alternative" to an explanation presented elsewhere in the text.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of birdsong. In this context, "diminish" means reduce or lessen. The text establishes that birds sing to communicate over potentially large distances and that researchers believe that birds that live in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds that live in comparatively sparsely vegetated habitats. The text then explains that researchers hold this belief due to some effect of dense vegetation on the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. If birds sing to communicate over long distances, it would be logical to conclude that researchers believe that birds in densely vegetated habitats sing at lower frequencies than birds in relatively sparse habitats do because dense vegetation diminishes the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that dense vegetation can "exceed," or surpass or go beyond, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel, not that dense vegetation goes farther than that distance. Choice C is incorrect because it would not be sensible to say that dense vegetation can "encompass," or enclose or encircle, the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel. The distance that sounds can travel is not an object that can be enclosed or encircled by vegetation. Choice D is incorrect because there is no information in the text indicating that dense vegetation can "conceal," or hide or keep from being observed, the distance that high-frequency sounds travel. Instead, the text suggests that dense vegetation reduces the distance that high-frequency sounds can travel.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Sam Gilliam’s artworks. As used in this context, “creating” means producing or bringing something into existence. The text indicates that Gilliam is an artist who made draped canvases and, later, quilt-like paintings. This context supports the idea that Gilliam explored different styles in his art by creating special types of paintings. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that Gilliam actually explored and pursued the creation of quilt-like paintings; he wasn’t just “predicting,” or declaring in advance, the existence of these paintings. Choice B is incorrect because in this context “refusing” would mean rejecting, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that Gilliam rejected his quilt-like paintings. Instead, the text indicates that he was exploring and pursuing a new art style in these paintings. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “hiding” would mean concealing from view, and there is nothing in the text to suggest that Gilliam attempted to conceal his quilt-like paintings. Instead, the text indicates that he was exploring and pursuing a new art style in these paintings.  </p>

          <p>The following text is adapted from Pam Muñoz Ryan’s 2020 novel <em>Mañanaland</em>. In the village where Max lives, there is an old fortress called La Reina. Children in the village say that the fortress is haunted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For as long as he could remember, Max had begged Papá [his father] to take him to see La Reina and the ruins up close. He’d be a hero among his friends if he was the first boy to cross the haunted gates! Just because Papá didn’t believe in ghosts didn’t mean they weren’t there. Maybe this summer Papá would finally take him. He <em>was</em> almost twelve.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall purpose of the text. The text indicates that "for as long as he could remember," Max had "begged" his father to take him to La Reina. This point is later emphasized in the text by indicating that "this summer" his father might "finally take" Max to visit La Reina. Thus, the purpose of the text as a whole is to show how much Max wants to visit La Reina.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The text does not discuss Papa’s feelings toward Max. Rather, it mentions that Max has long wanted Papa to take him to La Reina and that, unlike Max and some other children, Papa does not believe that La Reina is haunted. Choice B is incorrect. The text mentions that Max is "almost twelve" at the time, which suggests anticipation of growing up rather than refusal to. Choice C is incorrect. The text indicates that Max hopes to visit La Reina during the current summer, but nothing suggests that Max dislikes summer.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the identification of maize’s wild ancestor. In this context, to "confirm" means to establish the truth or correctness of something. The text explains that maize "shows so little resemblance to any wild plant that genetic research was necessary" to establish its ancestry, which was ultimately traced to teosinte grass. This context conveys the idea that scientific verification was required to establish an ancestral relationship with certainty—that is, to confirm teosinte grass as maize’s ancestor.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because to "acquire" means to obtain or gain possession of something. Although their research likely required scientists to acquire samples of maize and teosinte grass, the text does not suggest that this was the ultimate goal of their work, which instead probed the connection between the two plants. Choice B is incorrect because to "develop" means to create something or to promote the growth of something, and the ancestral relationship between teosinte grass and maize already existed as a biological fact in the deep past, which scientists then verified through research; because this relationship already existed, the scientists can’t be said to have either created it or encouraged its growth. Choice C is incorrect because to "attract" means to entice something or to bring about a relationship or connection between two things, while the ancestral relationship between teosinte grass and maize already existed as a biological fact; rather than bringing about the relationship between the two plants, the scientists instead verified the prior existence of it.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of using magnetism to detect stress in buried metal pipes. In this context, "exploited" means made productive use of. The text indicates that the magnetic fields of some metals change under stress and that Saleem and colleagues showed that it is possible to measure those changes from a distance, thereby demonstrating that the integrity of underground metal pipes can be evaluated without having to unearth them. This context thus indicates that Saleem and colleagues made productive use of, or exploited, this tendency of the metals’ magnetic fields.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context, "hypothesized" would mean made a tentative assumption to be evaluated in a study or experiment. Although Saleem and colleagues may have had one or more hypotheses for these experiments, the text presents the information about the tendency of some metals’ magnetic fields to change under stress as a known fact that the researchers made productive use of, not as a hypothesis to be evaluated. The text after the colon indicates that the researchers were not evaluating whether such changes occur but whether those changes can be measured at a distance. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "discounted" would mean downplayed or ignored, but the text does not suggest that Saleem and colleagues minimized or ignored the tendency of the magnetic fields of some metals to change under stress. Rather, the text indicates that this tendency is the basis for Saleem and colleagues’ method of assessing the pipes’ integrity. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text indicates that Saleem and colleagues "redefined," or reevaluated or reformulated, the tendency of some metals’ magnetic fields to change under stress. Instead, the text indicates that the researchers made use of that tendency to demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate the integrity of underground pipes without unearthing them.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Gabriela González and team’s detection of gravitational waves. In this context, "ambiguity" means uncertainty or doubtfulness. The text explains that although skeptics had thought that direct evidence of gravitational waves would be too faint to be detected, researchers led by González claimed that a chirping sound captured by Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory antennas nevertheless provided such evidence. The text goes on to say that detailed statistical analysis confirmed the observation of gravitational waves with a high degree of confidence—that is, with near certainty—a finding that helped to preclude, or rule out, any claims that the signal’s attribution to gravitational waves might be ambiguous or doubtful.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. In this context, "inconspicuousness" would mean the quality of being unnoticeable or difficult to detect. Although the text indicates that skeptics had doubted whether gravitational waves could be observed directly because of their presumed faintness (which suggests that gravitational waves were expected to be difficult to detect), the blank portion of the text isn’t referring to the possibility that gravitational waves are unnoticeable or undetectable. Instead, the focus of the last sentence is González’s team’s observation of a chirping sound that they attributed to gravitational waves, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that through statistical analysis, they ruled out the possibility that the sound they observed was undetectable. Rather, the skeptical view presented in the text suggests that there could be some ambiguity about the source of the chirping, but statistical analysis virtually eliminated this uncertainty. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, "discretion" would mean good judgment, and it wouldn’t make sense to say that an event, such as the detection of gravitational waves, would show judgment, much less that the event’s capacity to exercise good judgment would be precluded by statistical analysis confirming its attribution. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "probability" would mean likelihood, and the text states that statistical analysis, which confirmed the signal with a high degree of confidence, suggests the likelihood that the chirping sound was produced by gravitational waves, not that the analysis helped to preclude this likelihood.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the author’s claim about the relationship between Neanderthals and <em>Homo sapiens</em>. As used in this context, “tenuous” means lacking substance. The end of the first sentence states that the author’s claim didn’t consider certain key pieces of evidence—“recent archaeological discoveries”—and is therefore weak.  </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to refer to the author’s claim as “disorienting,” or confusing. The text suggests that the author’s claim is insubstantial, not that it’s difficult to grasp. Choice C is incorrect because referring to the claim as “nuanced,” or subtle, wouldn’t make sense in context. According to the text, the claim is incomplete because it didn’t consider certain key information about recent archaeological finds; it doesn’t suggest that what’s in the claim lacks precision. Choice D is incorrect because saying that the claim is “unoriginal,” or imitative, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text faults the claim because it doesn’t consider certain key information about recent archaeological finds; it doesn’t suggest that the author’s claim lacks originality. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a whole. In the text, the narrator makes observations about her young niece, Dot, noting that Dot is making progress toward outgrowing babyhood and is growing stronger "day by day." The description of Dot purposefully exercising by "bouncing for hours" reinforces the narrator’s earlier characterization of Dot. The underlined sentence thus offers a detail that shows how Dot is growing stronger.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect. While a sentence earlier in the text mentions Celestine’s psychological state (sadness because Dot is growing fast), the underlined sentence doesn’t focus on Celestine at all. Instead, the sentence focuses on Dot’s physical activities to show that she is getting stronger. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes Dot’s behavior, not the narrator’s psychological characteristics. While a sentence earlier in the text establishes that the narrator, like Dot, was "impatient with babyhood," the underlined sentence specifically addresses Dot’s physical activities in her stroller. Choice D is incorrect. While an earlier sentence in the text mentions that Celestine is sad, the underlined sentence doesn’t focus on how Celestine feels nor does it describe a behavior that Celestine engages in. The sentence focuses entirely on Dot’s actions, describing her as  "bouncing for hours" to show that she is growing stronger.</p>

        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of baleen whale accessory spleens. In this context, “latent” means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales’ diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is “replicable,” or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn’t address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn’t be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is “predetermined,” or decided in advance, wouldn’t make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn’t been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales. Choice C is incorrect because it’s the opposite of what the context of the text is conveying. The second sentence of the text indicates that baleen whale accessory spleens may not be useless, not that they aren’t “operative,” or functional. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the location of the province of Xoconochco within the Aztec Empire. As used in this context, “peripheral” means situated toward the outer bounds rather than the center. The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required “a long overland journey.” This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire’s territory rather than near its center. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire as “unobtrusive,” or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it’s not clear how a province’s physical location would or wouldn’t be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco’s location was, the text emphasizes the province’s distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required “a long overland journey.” Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was “concealed,” or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn’t see it, and being hidden wouldn’t necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring “a long overland journey.” Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco’s location within the Aztec Empire was “approximate” would mean that the location either wasn’t precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco’s location is known and that it was far from the empire’s capital, so there’s no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of advance indications of solar flares. In this context the word "impending" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun’s corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful—solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth—and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic—increased brightness in a particular region of the corona—comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun’s corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were "antecedent," or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word "innocuous," or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist. But the word "perpetual," or never-ending, would in context indicate that the flare exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun’s corona, which would not make logical sense.</p>

<p>An excavation in Chiquihuite Cave in central Mexico has upended the belief that approximately 13,000 years ago, a group known as the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America.

<p>The objects uncovered in Chiquihuite Cave are intriguing, but it is premature to characterize them as tools.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim about the Clovis people in Text 1. Text 1 explains that the idea that the Clovis people were the first human inhabitants of North America has been overturned by the unearthing of stone tools in Chiquihuite Cave in Mexico. The tools were found in a layer of earth that is over 33,000 years old—much older than the Clovis people’s arrival 13,000 years ago. The text ends with the claim that the tools reveal that humans lived in the cave long before the Clovis people reached the continent. Text 2, on the other hand, disputes the idea that the stone pieces are definitely tools. Text 2 states that the pieces are so roughly shaped that they may have simply naturally broken off from rocks and, moreover, that no other signs of human activity have been found in the cave. In other words, Text 2 argues that there is no proof yet that humans made the pieces as tools or were even present in the cave. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that the claim that humans occupied Chiquihuite Cave long before the Clovis people reached North America rests on an assumption about the stone pieces—that they are human-made tools—that is not sufficiently supported by available evidence.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 1 doesn’t claim that human inhabitants of Chiquihuite Cave and the Clovis people had any connection; the author of Text 1 focuses only on the timing of each group’s presence in North America. Further, the author of Text 2 makes no mention of the Clovis people and indicates that it isn’t clear yet that any human group did inhabit Chiquihuite Cave. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that the author believes the stone pieces probably are human-made tools and will be confirmed as such by further analysis; instead, the author of Text 2 emphasizes the current lack of evidence of human activity in the cave. Choice D is incorrect because Text 2 focuses on the issue of characterizing the stone pieces as tools made by humans, not on the timing of any particular group’s activity in North America; further, Text 1 seems to support the common belief that the Clovis people reached North America 13,000 years ago and challenges only the idea that they were the continent’s first inhabitants. Therefore, there’s no reason to think the author of Text 2 would say that the author of Text 1 overlooks evidence that the Clovis people were active as early as is commonly thought.</p>

        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of how biodiversity loss due to invasive species can be avoided. As used in this context, “preventable” means able to be stopped or kept from happening. The text indicates that “people can take simple steps” to avoid bringing possible invasive species into new environments. It presents these steps as an example of how biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “undeniable,” or something that can’t be proved to be wrong. Although the text may suggest that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is something that really happens, the word that completes the text must make the first sentence into an assertion that is illustrated by the second sentence, and the second sentence illustrates the idea that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable, not undeniable. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “common,” or something that happens regularly. Additionally, the text doesn’t provide any information about how frequently invasive species cause biodiversity loss. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn’t make sense to say that a simple step like washing your shoes after traveling is an example of biodiversity loss due to invasive species being “concerning,” or something that is troubling or causes worry. Although the text implies that the phenomenon of biodiversity loss due to invasive species is itself a concerning phenomenon, the word that completes the text must make the first sentence into an assertion that is illustrated by the second sentence, and the second sentence illustrates the idea that biodiversity loss due to invasive species is preventable, not concerning. </p>

<p>A team led by Bernardo Strassburg has found that rewilding farmland (returning the land to its natural state) could help preserve biodiversity and offset carbon emissions. The amount of farmland that would need to be restored, they found, is remarkably low. Rewilding a mere 15% of the world’s current farmland would prevent 60% of expected species extinctions and help absorb nearly 299 gigatons of carbon dioxide—a clear win in the fight against the biodiversity and climate crises.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span aria-level="2" role="heading"><strong>Text 2</strong></span></p>
<p>While Strassburg’s team’s findings certainly offer encouraging insight into the potential benefits of rewilding, it’s important to consider potential effects on global food supplies. The researchers suggest that to compensate for the loss of food-producing land, remaining farmland would need to produce even more food. Thus, policies focused on rewilding farmland must also address strategies for higher-yield farming.</p>

Text 1 is extremely positive about Strassburg’s team’s findings, calling the potential results "a clear win in the fight against the biodiversity and climate crises." Text 2 is not as positive, arguing that while the findings point to "potential benefits," we also need to consider the "potential effects on global food supplies."</p><p>Choice B is incorrect.

<p>In <span data-ssml-say-as="date">1954</span> George Balanchine choreographed a production of <em>The Nutcracker</em>, a ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage <em>The Nutcracker</em> each year. <span aria-label="Referenced Content" role="region"><u>But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced.</u></span> Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences.</p>

<p><strong><span aria-level="2" role="heading">Text 2</span></strong></p>
<p><em>The Nutcracker</em> is outdated, but it should be kept because it’s a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show <em>Hot Chocolate Nutcracker</em> combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1. Text 1 begins by noting the success of <em>The Nutcracker</em> but then claims that the ballet is "stuck in the past" and should "no longer be produced." Text 2 begins by conceding that <em>The Nutcracker</em> is indeed outdated but argues that it should continue to be performed, states that the show can be updated to include more contemporary dance styles, and provides an example of one such modernized version, <em>Hot Chocolate Nutcracker</em>. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of <em>The Nutcracker</em> instead of completely rejecting the show.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 advocates for using creative ways to update <em>The Nutcracker</em> and therefore wouldn’t respond to the underlined claim by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version. Choice B is incorrect because although the authors of both texts claim that <em>The Nutcracker</em> is outdated, neither text suggests that contemporary audiences have largely stopped attending productions of the show. On the contrary, Text 2 states that <em>The Nutcracker</em> is a holiday favorite and generates substantial income for some dance companies. Choice C is incorrect because although Text 2 provides an example of a contemporized version of <em>The Nutcracker</em>, the text doesn’t suggest that offering modernized versions is a way to increase income for most dance companies. Rather, the author of Text 2 suggests that offering modernized versions is a way to make the ballet discussed in Text 1 feel less outdated.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to foreground Queen Dido’s strong emotional response to Aeneas’s story. Throughout, the text emphasizes how deeply the queen is affected by both Aeneas’s tale and persona. At the outset, the speaker explicitly states that "anxious cares...seiz’d the queen" and then uses the metaphor of fire ("within her veins a flame unseen" and "secret fire") to evoke the warmth of Dido’s feelings for Aeneas. In addition, the line "His words, his looks, imprinted in her heart" suggests the deep impression that Aeneas’s story makes on Dido, eliciting passion for him ("improv[ing] the passion") and empathy for his suffering ("increas[ing] the smart").</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because there’s no indication in the text that Dido is skeptical of Aeneas’s account, much less that she’s trying to conceal that skepticism. On the contrary, the text shows her being moved by his words and developing feelings for him. Choice C is incorrect. While the text mentions that Dido is impressed by Aeneas’s "valor, acts, and birth," which might suggest (but doesn’t necessarily entail) intellectual engagement, the text doesn’t represent Dido’s engagement with Aeneas in a manner that suggests a balance between emotion and intellect. Rather, the text primarily emphasizes her emotional response—specifically her attraction to Aeneas and her emotional investment in his story, indicating that his "valor, acts, and birth inspire / Her soul with love, and fan the secret fire" and that his words and looks elicit passion and empathy. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Dido is worried about Aeneas discovering a secret she is concealing from him. Though the text begins by mentioning Dido’s "anxious cares," this refers to her growing passion for Aeneas and pity for his suffering, not to worry about a secret she is concealing. The text’s reference to a "flame unseen" and "secret fire" points to Dido’s growing feelings for Aeneas that develop as he recounts his tale, not to a secret that existed before their encounter; moreover, the text provides no indication that Dido is worried Aeneas might discover these feelings.</p>

<p>Dominique Potvin and colleagues captured five Australian magpies (<em>Gymnorhina tibicen</em>) to test a new design for attaching tracking devices to birds. As the researchers fitted each magpie with a tracker attached by a small harness, they noticed some magpies without trackers pecking at another magpie’s tracker until it broke off.

<p>It can be tempting to think that animals are deliberately providing help when we see them removing trackers and other equipment from one another, especially when a species is known to exhibit other cooperative behaviors.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the researchers’ perspective in Text 1 on the behavior of the magpies without trackers. According to Text 1, Dominique Potvin and colleagues observed magpies without trackers pecking at a tracker on another magpie until the device fell off. The researchers suggested that the birds might have been attempting to help the other bird, with no benefit to themselves. Text 2 generally discusses scenarios in which animals have been observed removing trackers from each other. The text cautions that it shouldn’t be assumed that these animals are helping one another deliberately, since they might simply be pecking at trackers out of curiosity, causing them to fall off eventually. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to Potvin and colleagues’ perspective in Text 1 by saying that the behavior of the magpies without trackers could be adequately explained without suggesting that they were attempting to assist the other magpie.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses the novelty, or the newness and unusual quality, of the captive settings in which animals have been observed to remove trackers from other animals, nor does it suggest that such novelty might account for this behavior. Instead, the text suggests that it’s the novelty of the tracking equipment itself that might cause the behavior: interested in the trackers because they’re unusual, animals might paw or peck at them until they fall off. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 never suggests that when animals remove trackers from other animals, they do so because they wish to obtain the trackers for themselves. Instead, Text 2 argues that animals paw or peck at trackers because they are merely curious about them. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn’t argue that when captured animals are observed removing trackers from each other, their behavior should be regarded as selfless only if all of them participate in it. Instead, the text argues that the behavior may not be selfless at all and may instead be attributed to animals’ curiosity about the new and unusual trackers.</p>

<p>Polar bears sustain themselves primarily by hunting seals on the Arctic sea ice, but rising ocean temperatures are causing the ice to diminish, raising concerns about polar bear population declines as these large predators’ seal-hunting habitats continue to shrink.

<p>Monitoring carried out by researchers from the Norwegian Polar Institute shows that the polar bear population on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard remains stable and well nourished despite rapidly declining sea ice in recent years.

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer. Text 2 describes how the Svalbard polar bears have adapted to the loss of sea ice by diversifying their diet and feeding on reindeer and seabird eggs, resulting in a “stable and well nourished” population despite environmental challenges. This counters the underlined claim that polar bears facing a loss of sea ice are at “great risk of extinction” by the end of the century. </p><p>Choice B is incorrect. Text 2 does not challenge the fact that sea ice is rapidly declining in the Arctic due to warming ocean temperatures. In fact, it states that the Svalbard polar bears have faced “rapidly declining sea ice in recent years.” Choice C is incorrect. The claim in Text 1 is specific to polar bear populations affected by the loss of seal hunting habitats, so unaffected populations are irrelevant to the claim. Also, Text 2 doesn’t mention any polar bear populations that haven’t yet been affected by loss of seal hunting habitats. It focuses on a population that has been affected by sea-ice loss but has managed to survive and thrive nevertheless. Choice D is incorrect. Text 2 doesn’t imply that polar bears rely on a single seal-hunting strategy. In fact, the researcher in Text 2 would say that Text 1 fails to account for polar bears’ ability to develop other hunting strategies and food sources. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of the artist Diego Velázquez’s influence outside Spain. As used in this context, “confined to” means restricted to. The text says that Velázquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were influenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Velázquez’s influence was hardly (or almost not) confined to, or restricted to, Spain. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn’t make logical sense to claim that his influence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Velázquez’s techniques would by definition be influenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his influence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that deliberately limiting Velázquez’s influence outside Spain was ever considered by anyone. Thus, even if it is true that his influence was not repressed, or restrained, it doesn’t make logical sense to say so in this context. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it best states the main purpose of the text, which is to make a case for the importance of Scott Joplin’s less famous works. The text begins by introducing Joplin’s most popular works and then goes on to assert that gaining a full understanding of Joplin’s creativity requires a consideration of his lesser-known pieces as well. The text concludes by characterizing the lesser-known works "Pleasant Moments" and <em>Treemonisha</em> as masterpieces that deserve to be famous. These details indicate that the text’s main purpose is to argue that more attention should be given to Joplin’s lesser-known works.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect. Although the text discusses some of the ragtime music and an opera that Joplin composed, it does not compare the two types of music in general. Instead, the text argues that Joplin’s lesser-known works, including his opera, deserve as much attention as his more famous ragtime pieces receive. Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses only Joplin’s music and does not ask music lovers to listen to a variety of composers. Instead, the text encourages listeners to pay attention to Joplin’s lesser-known works in order to gain a full understanding of his creativity. Choice D is incorrect because the text does not discuss how Joplin learned to compose and perform ragtime music. Instead, the text focuses on Joplin’s less famous works and makes a case for their importance.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by mentioning Catherine L. Cardelús, "a researcher who studies canopy soil." The text then provides information about her chosen research topic: the formation of canopy soil in tree branches, the role of canopy soil in preserving a healthy water cycle in rainforests, and Cardelús’s specific interest in "the canopy soils in large choibá trees in rainforests in Costa Rica." Thus, the text introduces a researcher and then gives information about what she researches.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t mention any disagreement between researchers, nor does it describe how such a disagreement was resolved. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t present an idea that Cardelús disagrees with; rather, it describes her research interests and the significance of canopy soil. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn’t compare the sizes of different types of trees over time. While the text mentions "large choibá trees," it doesn’t compare them to any other tree type or discuss changes in tree size over several years.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text about Latro, the main character in Gene Wolfe’s novel <em>Soldier of the Mist</em>. In this context, "preserve" means save or keep from destruction or loss. The text describes Latro as a character who loses his memory whenever he sleeps. The text goes on to explain that before going to sleep, Latro records his most important memories to prevent him from forgetting, or losing, them. The context therefore supports the idea that Latro records his most important experiences in an effort to save, or preserve, his memory of them from loss.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "suspect" would mean mistrust, which wouldn’t make sense in this context. The text emphasizes that in writing down his experiences, Latro carefully chooses those which are most important to him and thus worth remembering later, not that he is mistrustful or has reason to doubt the experiences he records. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, "suggest" would mean propose for consideration. The text emphasizes the fact that Latro actually records those experiences that he has decided are most important to him, not that he merely proposes which experiences to consider for inclusion in his scroll. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, "imagine" would either mean form a mental image of or fabricate, neither of which would logically complete the text. Although it’s possible that reviewing records from previous days might enable Latro to reconstruct mental images of what has happened to him in the past, the text emphasizes the fact that Latro carefully selects and writes down his experiences so he will remember them in the future, not so that he can form mental pictures of them as he writes them down. In a similar vein, the text emphasizes that Latro is recording experiences that have actually happened to him, not that he’s fabricating the experiences he records.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> D
        <p>Choice D is the best answer because it best describes the overall structure of the text. The first part of the text presents the favorable opinions that others hold of Mr. Ely: the laity of Milby regard him as having "remarkable powers and learning" and assume that he also impresses people in London, while his fellow clergy see him as "a discreet and agreeable fellow." The text then goes on to describe Mr. Ely’s behaviors that enable him to cultivate and preserve his positive reputation. The text conveys that he avoids confrontations, abstaining from "warm discussion[s]" (that is, heated or contentious ones); that he avoids offending anyone by "rarely [saying] what he thought himself" and by refraining from openly ridiculing anyone; and that he doesn’t give anyone any reason to ridicule or belittle his own character ("he never gave any one an opportunity of laughing at <em>him</em>"). In other words, these are all behaviors that suggest that Mr. Ely avoids doing anything that might make people dislike him or think poorly of him. Thus, the text begins by presenting the favorable view that people have of Mr. Ely and then describes the behaviors that enable him to maintain that favorable view.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn’t describe any events that caused people’s regard for Mr. Ely to diminish. Instead, the text explains that the people of Milby hold him in high regard and describes behaviors that suggest how he cultivates that regard. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn’t suggest that Mr. Ely’s neighbors are more naïve than Londoners are or that they’ve been misled. Although the text suggests that Mr. Ely is very guarded in his outward behavior and conceals from people when he may be internally mocking them, which might suggest that people know him less well than they think they do, there’s nothing in the text to suggest that Londoners are less naïve and therefore less easily misled than Mr. Ely’s neighbors are. The text states that the people of Milby believe Mr. Ely to be "remarkable" and that they assume that people in London must find him so, too; it doesn’t say anything about what Londoners actually think of him. Choice C is incorrect. While the text discusses Mr. Ely’s public conduct at length, describing the ways in which he carefully cultivates an agreeable public persona, the text doesn’t discuss how Mr. Ely behaves in private at all; it therefore wouldn’t be accurate to say that the text begins by emphasizing a discrepancy between his public and private conduct. Furthermore, although the text concludes with examples illustrating that Mr. Ely typically doesn’t share his true thoughts, indicating that he may be hiding aspects of his true personality when in public, and although the text as a whole conveys the idea that Mr. Ely benefits from this behavior, which might hint at his motives for doing so, the text doesn’t conclude by alluding to those motives. Instead, the text merely concludes with a description of the behaviors he engages in to win his neighbors’ and colleagues’ approval.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because as used in the text, "mingled" most nearly means combined. In the text, the speaker refers to several concepts mingling together and then compares this to "the blending of" two other things (an exotic plant and the fragrance of a strange flower). This comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts of love, April, and the gold of someone’s hair as being blended together, or combined.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because "mingled" means combined, not identified. The speaker names several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) and then moves to a comparison of their mingling together to "the blending of" a plant and the scent of a flower, conveying the idea that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined. Choice C is incorrect. The text as a whole may refer to a memory, but the comparison of the mingling of several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) to "the blending of" a plant and the scent of a flower conveys that the speaker views those concepts as actually blended together, or combined, and not simply remembered at the same time. Choice D is incorrect. The speaker refers to several concepts (love, April, and the gold color of someone’s hair) and then compares the mingling together of those concepts to "the blending of" a plant and the scent of a flower; rather than suggesting that the concepts are celebrated, this comparison conveys that the speaker views the concepts as blended together, or combined.</p>

        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. In the text, the narrator explains that she walks around her neighborhood, making a "mental map" of the area that she imagines herself navigating through. She then states that she rehearses "the small world’s scheme"—that is, imagines moving through her mental map—and challenges herself to use the map in her mind while lying in bed at night. The underlined portion presents two such challenges (getting to the store through backyards and traveling from school to a friend’s house) and thus provides examples of what the narrator thinks about at night.</p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the underlined portion makes no mention of memorizing a telephone number. Although the narrator mentions that she had to learn the home telephone number before her mother would give her permission to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about memorizing the telephone number. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion refers to navigation tasks like finding a route to a store only through backyards, the text contains no specific directions to any store, nor is any store identified as the narrator’s favorite. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion makes no mention of the narrator’s mother and doesn’t address the narrator’s relationship with her. Although the narrator mentions that her mother gave her permission as a child to walk around the neighborhood, there is nothing in the underlined portion or the rest of the text about the mother or her relationship to her child.</p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> C
        <p>Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of the study of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. In this context, “negligible” means not significant enough to be worth considering. The text says that the study challenged the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples. The text goes on to say that the researchers found that “in fact, as many as half” the hunters in the groups studied were female. The phrase “in fact” establishes a contrast indicating that the finding that as many as half the hunters were female differs from the accepted view. This context suggests, then, that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was negligible. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among prehistoric peoples were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “inevitable,” or unavoidable. Nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view is that prehistoric peoples could not avoid female participation in hunting. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the accepted view of female participation in hunting among prehistoric peoples is that such participation was “satisfactory,” or sufficient to meet a requirement or demand. There is no information in the text about any demands or requirements regarding female participation in hunting, let alone any information about how much female participation in hunting would be enough to satisfy those demands or requirements. Instead, the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half the hunters in the groups studied were female, suggesting that the accepted view is that female participation in hunting was low. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the study challenged the accepted view by showing that as many as half of hunters among the prehistoric peoples studied were female, which suggests that the accepted view is that female participation was low, not that female participation was “commonplace,” or ordinary or unremarkable. Although the study under discussion suggests that female participation may have been commonplace, that study is presented as challenging the accepted view, not as reinforcing the accepted view. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> B
        <p>Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of bronze- and brass-casting techniques used by the Igun Eronmwon guild. In this context “adhere to” would mean to act in accordance with. The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques. </p><p>Choice A is incorrect because in this context “experiment with” would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “experiment with” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice C is incorrect because in this context “improve on” would mean to make better. Although using motors rather than manual bellows might be an improved approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members “don’t strictly observe every tradition.” The phrase “improve on” wouldn’t support the contrast because regularly making changes to the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context “grapple with” would mean to try hard to solve a difficult problem. Although bronze- and brass-casting are likely challenging tasks, nothing in the text suggests that the guild members have any particular difficulties with the techniques passed down since the thirteenth century. </p>

          <b>Correct Answer:</b> A
        <p>Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text’s discussion of Ronyoung Kim’s novel <em>Clay Walls</em>. In this context, "distinct" means clearly separate and different. The text indicates that the novel consists of three sections and that each section is narrated from the perspective of a different character. This context supports the idea that Kim’s novel features three distinct perspectives.</p><p>Choice B is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as "required," or demanded as necessary to be done or provided, wouldn’t make sense in context. When writing a novel, a novelist is free to choose to narrate the story from any number of perspectives. There’s nothing in the text to indicate that providing three perspectives was demanded of Kim. Instead, the text focuses on identifying the three different perspectives featured in Kim’s novel. Choice C is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as "unintended," or not planned as a purpose or goal, wouldn’t make sense in context. Authors make deliberate choices about the perspectives they feature in their works, and the text indicates that Kim chose to incorporate three different perspectives in her novel. Choice D is incorrect because describing the three perspectives in Kim’s novel as "unknown," or not revealed, wouldn’t make sense in context. The text directly identifies the three perspectives that appear in her novel as those of Faye and her two parents, Haesu and Chun, which indicates that the novel’s perspectives are in fact known.</p>
