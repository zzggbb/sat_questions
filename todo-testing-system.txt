Make a testing system, where students select answers and then they get a score report
at the end. Basically doing what bluebook does, except better. Bluebook is
difficult to access. Also bluebook sucks because its hard to go over the wrong
answers. When going over wrong answers, it shows the answers by default and you
have to click to hide them. Also it doesn't say whether or not you got the
question wrong, so we always look at a question thinking the student got it
wrong, when they really got it right. Also bluebook displays parenthesis wrong!

standard bluebook test:
            information and ideas: 12-14 questions
              craft and structure: 13-15 questions
              expression of ideas: 8-12 questions
     standard english conventions: 11-15 questions
                          algebra: 13-15 questions
problem solving and data analysis: 5-7 questions
                    advanced math: 13-15 questions
                geometry and trig: 5-7 questions
total: 100 questions
